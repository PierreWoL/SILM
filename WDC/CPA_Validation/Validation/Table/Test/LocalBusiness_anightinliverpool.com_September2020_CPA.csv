Garlands holds a mixture of gay and straight people who are all out for one thing - a funky night! Entry fee is about £10, but it's well worth it.

Drinks are quite expensive but the atmosphere is great and the music is a mix of house and dance tunes with some electro pumped in for good measure. It's a 'Wear what you Dare' place, which gives it a feel good feeling because no one fits in, you're just individual and accepted.

From what I can gather, this didn't turn out as expected resulting in Garlands coming home to Liverpool in March 2018 each and every Saturday night till 6am.
