In the meantime, up in the sky a new cosmic body appeared in conjunction with Earth ,s primordial sun which the ancients considered to have been the self-begotten daughter of their former sole divinity.

This volume offers an indispensable analysis of the most vicious killers of all - orcs. Born and bred for war, they are an awful, brutish, violent species and, despite their constant infighting and backstabbing, their horde armies remain a dire threat to all races. To them, war is life. Beginning with an examination of the fighting methods of the individual orc warrior, the book expands to look at how they do battle in their small warbands and in vast armies. Using vivid, illuminating illustrations, it reveals the tactics, technology and disposition of all the orc troop types, from lightly armed archers and heavily armored shock troops to their wolf cavalry and siege engines, uncovering startling regional variations and highly specialized fighters such as beserkers and battle shamans. Finally, it will explore specific key battles that orcs have fought in to develop the fullest possible understanding of these loathsome, terrifying creatures and the ways in which they go to war.","[None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","[None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2015.0,"[None, '12.43', '9.99', '8.41', '8.37', '9.1', '11.11', '12.64', '12.94', '15.85', '15.81']",5.0,3.56,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",39.0

Heart of Change: Real-Life Stories of How People Change Their Organizations,"Pisano, Gary P.,Shih, Willy C.",9781422187333.0,Hardcover,Ingram Publisher Services,https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781422187333-de.jpg,"Moving beyond the process of change Why is change so hard? Because in order to make any transformation successful, you must change more than just the structure and operations of an organization--you need to change people's behavior. And that is never easy. The Heart of Change is your guide to helping people think and feel differently in order to meet your shared goals., According to bestselling author and renowned leadership expert John Kotter and coauthor Dan Cohen, this focus on connecting with people's emotions is what will spark the behavior change and actions that lead to success. Now freshly designed, The Heart of Change is the engaging and essential complement to Kotter's worldwide bestseller Leading Change. Building off of Kotter's revolutionary eight-step process, this book vividly illustrates how large-scale change can work., With real-life stories of people in organizations, the authors show how teams and individuals get motivated and activated to overcome obstacles to change--and produce spectacular results. Kotter and Cohen argue that change initiatives often fail because leaders rely too exclusively on data and analysis to get buy-in from their teams instead of creatively showing or doing something that appeals to their emotions and inspires them to spring into","['InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2012.0,"['20.31', '25.09', '24.79', None, '22.06', '21.24', '20.7', '21.57', '17.99', '12.76', '20.22']",5.0,3.95,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",1962.0

It was a non-typical training manual filled with personal stories of intrigue and even games. Its goal was to encourage the development of light reconnaissance scouting skills within the British Army. The book was well received by various armies of its time, including the French Army. His successful defense of Mafeking (1899-1900) in South Africa made Baden-Powell a well-known national hero in Britain. But what completely surprised Baden-Powell was that his book was eagerly taken up by teachers and youth groups to help organize outdoor activities and sport. He eventually embraced the idea of adapting his work into a new youth-oriented book, Scouting for Boys (1908) which went on to sell approx. 150 million copies to date. It was that follow-on book that firmly launched the international Boy Scouts movement.

Wasn't his doctrine of good manners, elegant dress and chivalry towards the ladies once the yardstick by which all human behaviour was measured? How could \""road rage\"" have become the social norm in a country where simply not raising one's hat was once considered an act of aggression? When did men stop wearing cravats, shaking hands with each other and allowing ladies to take the most comfortable seats?And why? The Chap is the long-running magazine with a mission to revive gentlemanly behaviour and sartorial elegance. From the beauty of a tweed jacket to the simple pleasure derived from smoking a pipe, the renaissance of dandyism is celebrated here in the finest articles selected from The Chap, with all the panache one would expect from the splendid fellows behind The Chap Manifesto and The Chap Almanac. From the Philosophy of Grooming to the Semiotics of Eyewear, from Stephen Fry's thoughts on being made Pipe Smoker of the Year to the abiding horror of the ready-to-wear suit, The Best of the Chap is for all those who prefer a trilby to a baseball cap, and a brogue to","[None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","[None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'UsedCondition', 'NewCondition']",2005.0,"[None, '43.9', '105.74', '45.75', '75.03']",5.0,4.12,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",24.0

As one of today's most provocative Christian leaders, she blends sardonic irreverence and brilliant theology to offer a new portrait of faith - one that is edgy, outrageous and, above all, real. Smart-mouthed and heavily tattooed, Nadia Bolz-Weber didn't consider herself `religious leader material' and didn't expect to find her vocation leading a funeral in a smoky, downtown comedy club., But surrounded by recovering alcoholics, depressives, and comedians, she realized these were her people and maybe she was meant to be their pastor. This compassionate book portrays both church and seekers as deeply flawed yet deeply faithful.","['InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'UsedCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2013.0,"['15.43', '12.12', '13.14', None, '14.06', '18.65', '11.37', '22.42', '20.39', '15.8', '14.18']",5.0,4.34,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",10033.0

In the follow-up to the critically acclaimed 'The Art of Classical Details,' Phillip James Dodd continues his look at some of the finest examples of contemporary classical architecture in Great Britain and the United States, while also examining how collaboration is the key to their successful design. In reality, collaborative relationships are rare, especially amongst designers, where each is often focused on their own individual objectives and unable to transcend their own egos., Often used as a catch phase, but not often realised, true collaboration requires an understanding - and an appreciation - of the role that all parties play in the design and construction of a home. 'An Ideal Collaboration' includes the work of some of the most notable names in contemporary residential design. Architects, decorators, landscape designers, consultants, builders, craftsmen, artists and vendors, all address the design process and the pivotal role that collaboration plays in creating cohesive timeless designs., AUTHOR: A native of Manchester, England, Phillip James Dodd attended the prestigious Prince of","['InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2015.0,"['40.03', '55.14', '36.58', '41.45', '57.63', '45.28', '36.94', None, '46.65', '43.97', '48.53']",5.0,0.0,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",0.0

"Old Churches, Ministers and Families of Virginia",Bishop [William] Meade,,,CD Archive,,"CD Archive. Zustand: BRAND NEW. BRAND NEW Book on CD Rom - This history of the Episcopal Church in Virginia focusses on a narrative of each parish in the state, with biographical and genealogical details on many of the early ministers and prominent members of that church. Complete transcripts of many colonial documents are included for most of the parishes.Like so many other nineteenth-century antiquaries, Bishop Meade conducted his research through a combination of onsite visits and correspondence with other antiquaries. In the preparation of this history, which was first published as a series of eighty newspaper articles, he attempted to locate and examine the surviving vestry books for each parish. In some cases he saw these records himself, and in other instances he relied on reports by others.Most of the articles have sprinkled through them extensive extracts and abstracts from colonial documents, including, in addition to the vestry books, such sources as court records, private letters and monumental inscriptions. Many of these records had not previously been published, and, although many have since been placed in print in more modern and comprehensive editions, there are undoubtedly records here, especially among the letters and inscriptions, which have not been published",InStock,UsedCondition,,31.45,,,EUR,

With an ancient history and an eight-verse tribute penned by Robert Burns, haggis is a Scottish cultural icon. So how did it come to acquire its bad boy image and earn such mixed reviews, ranging from the devotion of its fans to the deep revulsion of the uninitiated? In this informative and light-hearted book, Jo Macsween of the famous family of Edinburgh haggis makers, expertly guides you through the myths and magic to a new realm of haggis appreciation that transcends neeps, tatties and Burns Night., Featuring fifty mouth-watering recipes, Jo rewrites the rules and demonstrates that haggis is a versatile ingredient that can be savoured at all times of day and throughout the year. She even dares to challenge the long-standing association of haggis with whisky, and recommends a new coterie of drinking companions.","[None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","[None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2012.0,"[None, '4.29', '10.25', '6.43', '11.1', '7.3', '6.68', '5.65', '7.04', '11.62']",5.0,4.36,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",11.0

Augustus Baldwin Longstreet (1790-1870) was a lawyer, judge, state senator, newspaper editor, minister, political propagandist, and college president. He was also a writer who published one of Georgia's first important literary works in 1835, Georgia Scenes, Characters, Incidents, Etc. in the First Half Century of the Republic. John Donald Wade's biography of Longstreet was first published in 1924 but was out of print during most of Wade's lifetime. In this 1969 reissue, M. Thomas Inge provides a bibliography of Wade's published work in addition to an introduction.As Inge notes, this biography was one of the first attempts to assess the cultural background of southern literature and it was the first real effort to investigate the nature of southwestern humor. In the opening chapter Wade announces his theme by saying that the history of Longstreet becomes \""an epitome, in some sense, of American civilization.\"" The biography gradually narrows to a southern focus and as Inge remarks, Wade attempts \""to take a panoramic view of the psyche of an entire society through one representative figure.\"".",InStock,NewCondition,2010.0,31.23,,,EUR,

And if someone like me can become rich, then so can you - no matter what your present circumstances. Here is how I did it and what I learned along the way.' So writes Felix Dennis, who believes that almost anyone of reasonable intelligence can become rich, given sufficient motivation and application., How To Get Rich is a distillation of his business wisdom. Primarily concerned with the step-by-step creation of wealth, it ruthlessly dissects the business failures and financial triumphs of 'a South London lad who became rich virtually by accident'. Part manual, part memoir, part primer, this book is a template for those who are willing to stare down failure and transform their lives., Canny, infuriating, cynical and generous by turns, How To Get Rich is an invaluable guide to 'the surprisingly simple art of collecting money which already has your name on it'.","['InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2007.0,"['13.14', '11.69', '9.72', None, '10.41', '10.44', '11.95', '13.89', '9.84', '8.05', '16.38']",5.0,4.21,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",3194.0

Rubens: Hunting Scenes v. 2 (Hardback),Arnout Balis,9780199210411.0,Hardcover,"Brepols N.V., Belgium",,"Brepols N.V., Belgium, 1987. Hardback. Zustand: New. Language: English. Brand new Book. Rubens may be said to have revived the genre of hunting scenes, a theme whose popularity had declined since the Middle Ages. Moreover, he enriched the courtly allusions and contemporary preoccupations. Dr. Balis explores this updating of the genre by examining in the greatest detail Ruben's paintings and drawings of hunting scenes and thereby throws a fascinating light on the society in which the artist lived. This volume brings the hunting scenes together for the first time in a definitve catalogue raisonne that documents both the precedents for and the originality of Rubens's development of hunting iconography, and argues that the prolific production of Flemish animal painters in the 17th century owes its very existence to Rubens's example and his creation of a sympathetic audience. Both text and catalogue discuss the ever-important questions of what part Rubens himself played in the execution of these sometimes huge canvases, since he seems to have relied in some degree on the assistance of his studio or of specialized animal painters.",InStock,NewCondition,1987.0,136.92,,,EUR,

The maps are designed to reflect the age in which the artist lived. More than striving for artistic comprehensiveness in terms of art history, these atlases are intended to reflect the context in which the artists lived, worked and flourished.

Contributors hail from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, Mexico, Norway, and the U.S., and work in a broad range of situations, grade levels, activities, scales, and even national contexts. Projects include early year education through to adult literacy education and university contexts, describing a range of approaches to taking up new literacies and digital technologies within diverse learning practices. While the authors present detailed descriptions of using various digital resources like movie editing software, wikis, video conferencing, Twitter, and YouTube, they all agree that digital �stuff� - while important - is not the central concern. Instead, what they foreground in their discussions are theory-informed pedagogical orientations, collaborative learning theories, the complexities of teachers' workplaces, and young people's interests. Thus, a key premise in this collection is that teaching and learning are about deep engagement, representing meanings in a range of ways. These include acknowledging relationships and knowledge; thinking critically about events, phenomena, and processes; and participating in valued social and cultural","['InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', None, 'NewCondition', 'UsedCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2016.0,"['38.85', '34.72', '34.33', None, '26.5', '40.88', '24.42', '22.64', '37.91', '31.14', '30.52']",5.0,5.0,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",1.0

Revised edition. Language: English. Brand new Book. Blending scientific fact and sports trivia, Robert Adair examines what a baseball or player in motion does-and why. How fast can a batted ball go? What effect do stitch patterns have on wind resistance? How far does a curve ball break? Who reaches first base faster after a bunt, a right- or left-handed batter? The answers are often surprising -- and always illuminating.This newly revised third edition considers recent developments in the science of sport such as the neurophysiology of batting, bat vibration, and the character of the sweet spot. Faster pitchers, longer hitters, and enclosed stadiums also get a good, hard scientific look to determine their effects on the game. Filled with anecdotes about famous players and incidents, The Physics of Baseball provides fans with fascinating insights into America's favorite pastime.",InStock,NewCondition,2002.0,11.96,,,EUR,

"Chiron, Pholus and Nessus: To the Edge and Beyond","Reinhart, Melanie",9781909580176.0,Paperback,Starwalker Press,https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781909580176-de.jpg,"P�ginas: 190 G�neros: Sinopsis: This unique book offers the first comprehensive exploration of the Minor Planets now classified as 'Centaurs'. It was first published in 1996 (in Part II of 'Saturn, Chiron and the Centaurs'), and is still unsurpassed. This stand-alone version includes extra material on the naming of Nessus, and all technical information has been updated. If you resonate with the astrology of Chiron, this material is sure to interest you, as the themes of the Centaurs represent a vital extension of its meaning in the horoscope. Melanie Reinhart's ground-breaking work, 'Chiron and the Healing Journey', opened the eyes of the astrological world to Chiron's potential for distilling wisdom from our greatest suffering, and to the way its process accompanies our awakening. 'Chiron, Pholus and Nessus' expands this material in a lively seminar format. After being reclassified several times, Chiron is now the prototype of a new sub-category of celestial objects called 'The Centaurs', originating in the Kuiper Belt, beyond the edge of the solar system. These Minor Planets are 'messengers' from deep space which signify experiences of the transpersonal reality which facilitates our relationship with the celestial and earthly aspects of our nature and existence._,","['InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'NewCondition', None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2014.0,"['24.53', '14.89', None, '22.09', '25.05', '12.77', '18.92', '25.03', '14.33', '15.94', '13.18']",5.0,4.0,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",4.0

Put simply, the Egyptian afterlife is the quantum domain, and their deities are signs for microbial genes and proteins, describing a biophysical process of horizontal gene transfer (DNA exchange between species) ,for radical human evolution.The initial methodology included multiple reviews of the least corrupted Pyramid and Coffin Texts to categorize 108 key themes that were synthesized into 30 major idea strands, defining textual events and activities of major deities.

The book explores all of the widely-used modern types of motor and drive, including conventional and brushless D.C., induction motors and servo drives, providing readers with the knowledge to select the right technology for a given job.The third edition includes additional diagrams and worked examples throughout. New topics include digital interfacing and control of drives, direct torque control of induction motors and current-fed operation in DC drives., The material on brushless servomotors has also been expanded.Austin Hughes' approach, using a minimum of maths, has established Electric Motors and Drives as a leading guide for electrical engineers and mechanical engineers, and the key to a complex subject for a wider readership, including technicians, managers and students.","['InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'UsedCondition', None, 'UsedCondition']",2013.0,"['8771.3', '85.92', None, '52.77']",5.0,4.43,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",44.0

Brand new Book. When Duncan Cameron's mother dies, he is sent to live with his Uncle Gerald on a remote farm in Kent. What follows is a hypnotic tale of psychological suspense as this boy on the cusp of manhood enters his only living relative's ultra-masculine world of; a dark, erotically charged landscape in an England teetering on the brink of the Second World War.Originally published in 1948, The Scapegoat was Jocelyn Brooke's first novel and, as with many of his other works, occupies a fascinating space between fiction and autobiography. Described by novelist Peter Cameron as `almost unbelievably subversive and kinky', this unjustly neglected classic of gay fiction offers a quiet depiction of a childhood adrift in silence and despair, and a beautifully wrought exploration of masculinity.\""He is subtle as the devil\"" - John Betjeman\""Jocelyn Brooke is a great writer. . . . If you care enough for literature, seek out The Scapegoat\"" - Elizabeth Bowen\""It could not have been written more delicately or sensitively\"" - Sean O'Faolian\""Exceptionally well-written\""- Desmond MacCarthy.",InStock,NewCondition,2017.0,13.11,,,EUR,

This book brings together the results of fresh scholarly research to present a unique overview of the financial history of the Netherlands from the sixteenth century onwards. The Netherlands has always occupied a role in international finance way out of proportion with its geographical size. Since the eighteenth century, the country has been one of the largest exporters of capital in the world. In addition, several important financial innovations were pioneered in the Netherlands, such as a funded public debt, the famous Amsterdam Wisselbank, large public limited companies with transferable shares, and securitized international loans.

He made friends in Uganda, and they liked him so much he became the Ugandan consul., He pursued his wife for three years before she agreed to date him.

Love., But it's not the kind of love that stops at thoughts and feelings. Bob's love takes action.

Earning his degree in aerospace engineering and joining the Air Force as a pilot, Farmer was a natural for NASA's astronaut training program and was well on his way when a family situation forced him to drop out. But Farmer was not a man to let anything stand in the way of a dream. He spent the next decade and every cent he had building his own rocket in a barn on his ranch in Story, Texas, working toward the day when he could triumphantly launch it into space. By himself. Sharing his vision are his wife Audie and their children - daughters Sunshine and Stanley, and 15-year-old Shepard, already a budding engineer and eager to serve as mission control on the big day. Even Audie's father Hal, on hand to lend moral support, can see how his son-in-law's unwavering commitment has inspired the family with a common dream. On the eve of the long-anticipated launch, an unexpected problem arises.

Why? Because ring work replicates natural, multi-dimensional, functional, self-correcting movement. Rings reduce the destructive stress on the joints often caused by traditional weight lifting--with its repetitive, forced, linear \""grinding of the gears\"". With ring work, the adaptive, strength-enhancing stress goes to the muscles--where it belongs... The rings are strength saviors for the over-forties-and in many cases represent a wiser, safer choice for younger athletes seeking to push their physical capabilities to ever-greater heights. The forgiving, user-friendly rings have the power to: � Restore former strength lost to joint pain � Rekindle your passion for intense, results-producing exercise � Reengineer your body into a sleeker, tougher vehicle that continues to get stronger and stronger and stronger--pain-free � Reverse the damage and imbalance wrought by an over-reliance on machine-based exercise � Release you from the strength plateaus in your training--by introducing an infinite variability of adaptive challenge into your workouts � Reclaim your full physical capabilities--and then help you exceed those capabilities � Rejuvenate your system--through a newfound freedom from pain and a newfound ease of movement And the glory of it is that--in his inspirational Rings of Power--Mike Gillette",,,2015.0,,,,,

The catch? That 'right time' varies from person to person. Fortunately, as Dr Michael Breus proves in The Power of When, learning to work with your body clock to achieve maximum health and productivity is easy, exciting and fun., When we stop focusing on the 'how' and 'what' of our lives and start focusing on the 'when', we reveal our body's natural schedule and unlock our hidden potential. In The Power of When, Dr Breus presents a groundbreaking new programme based on the most cutting-edge research for how to get back in sync with your body's natural rhythm. Filled with fascinating facts, true-life success stories, fun personality quizzes and easy to follow guidelines, The Power of When will teach you how to not only understand your own body clock, but the body clocks of everyone around you., After you've taken Dr Breus's comprehensive chronotype (body clock) quiz (are you a bear, a lion, a dolphin, or a wolf?) you'll learn to schedule your day for peak productivity and well-being.

The collection is in good overall condition, with light signs of age and wear. As the following description indicates, much care was taken by OUP with the production of the book, the Press even going so far as to produce new type for it (examples of which are accompany a letter by the printer John Johnson). Unfortunately the book was not well received - a savage review [by Sir P. J. Dixon] in the Times Literary Supplement, 12 March 1931, drawing forth a pained response from the author, 19 March 1931 - and although Linear A remains undeciphered, the book's premise of a connection between the language of the Basques and that of the Minoans has never been seriously entertained.

Flowing floral patterns intertwine with stems and leaves, the smooth satin stitches contrasting wonderfully with the padded, knotted stitchery and untextured background. These natural designs are often fairly large and the sculptured patterns have an appealing bold quality, which is enhanced by the absence of colour and the addition of knitted fringed fringes., Pat Trott explains all the techniques with clear step-by-step photography and inspiring easy-to-follow projects.

He asks: What makes a house truly beautiful? Why are many new houses so ugly? Why do we argue so bitterly about sofas and pictures - and can differences of taste ever be satisfactorily resolved? To answer these questions and many more, de Botton looks at buildings across the world, from medieval wooden huts to modern skyscrapers; he examines sofas and cathedrals, tea sets and office complexes, and teases out a host of often surprising philosophical insights. The Architecture of Happiness will take you on a beguiling tour through the history and psychology of architecture and interior design, and will change the way you look at your home.'Engaging and intelligent ., . . full of splendid ideas, happily and beautifully expressed' Independent","['InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'UsedCondition', None, 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2014.0,"['9.96', '12.33', '9.52', '13.52', '12.11', '19.32', None, '9.33', '13.9', '8.23', '16.19']",5.0,3.85,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",8630.0

Coordination in Heterarchical Supply Chains: A Framework for the Design and Evaluation of Collaborative Planning Concepts (Advances in Information Systems and Management Science),"Kuppers, Peer",9783832535858.0,Paperback,Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH,https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9783832535858-de.jpg,"Today's globalized business environment is characterized by a strong competitive pressure which requires companies to improve their supply chains' effectiveness and efficiency by coordination. However, the organizational structures are more and more characterized by networks containing equal partners which restricts the application of coordination mechanisms. Collaborative planning aims at covering the resulting requirements and gains more and more attention in research and practice. Within these approaches, the companies' shared decision-space is collaboratively explored and evaluated by means of formally specified interaction processes which are connected to local planning models. These procedures allow to find a mutually agreed and beneficial planning solutions which improve the supply chain's overall performance. Within this domain, a limited degree of practical implementations has been identified. Thus, a large potential for supporting supply chain planners and IT-departments in the selection, customization, and implementation of suitable and promising coordination mechanisms exists. Addressing these potentials, as part of his doctoral studies Peer K�ppers developed the Framework for Intelligent Supply Chain Collaboration (FRISCO). It contains methods and tools for designing and modelling collaborative planning concepts as well as an agent-based simulation environment for the use case-driven and quantitative evaluation of their coordination performance. The framework's utility has been shown","['InStock', None, 'InStock', 'InStock', 'InStock']","['NewCondition', None, 'UsedCondition', 'NewCondition', 'NewCondition']",2015.0,"['99.27', None, '95.48', '99.13', '84.03']",5.0,0.0,"['EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR', 'EUR']",0.0

Ratchford was the first Confederate injured in a land battle in the Civil War and may have fought in more battles than any other soldier on either side. He knew all the great men of the Confederacy and fought in some of the most pivotal battles. Only four copies of the original 1909 publication were known to exist in 1971 when the facsimile was made. The book was actually written by Ratchford's daughter who was the Rare Book librarian at the University of Texas for 40 years. Her father told her stories of Stonewall Jackson, RE Lee, Davis, Hood, Hill, and Bragg and she wrote the reminiscences down to create a book that is more centered on people than events. An incredibly interesting item for any Civil War collector. Preface by Dr. Bluford B. Hestir. Begins page 5: \""BETHEL REGIMENT.
