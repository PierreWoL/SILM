The Slaughterman's Daughter,"A SUNDAY TIMES MUST READS PICK “Boundless imagination and a vibrant style . . . a heroine of unforgettable grit” DAVID GROSSMAN “A story of great beauty and surprise” GARY SHTEYNGART The townsfolk of Motal, an isolated, godforsaken town in the Pale of Settlement, are shocked when Fanny Keismann – devoted wife, mother of five, and celebrated cheese-maker – leaves her home at two hours past midnight and vanishes into the night. True, the husbands of Motal have been vanishing for years, but a wife and mother? Whoever heard of such a thing. What on earth possessed her? Could it have anything to do with Fanny’s missing brother-in-law, who left her sister almost a year ago and ran away to Minsk, abandoning their family to destitution and despair? Or could Fanny have been lured away by Zizek Breshov, the mysterious ferryman on the Yaselda river, who, in a strange twist of events, seems to have disappeared on the same night? Surely there can be no link between Fanny and the peculiar roadside murder on the way to Telekhany, which has left Colonel Piotr Novak, head of the Russian secret police, scratching his head.

Valse Triste,"When Michele, a young autistic child goes missing, Commissario Sergio Striggio is put in charge of the investigation. Searches turn up nothing, but there is an interesting connection with the mother’s past: when she was a child, her twin brother also went missing, never to be found. However, Striggio is finding it difficult to concentrate on the case. He is waiting for his father, Pietro, to come and stay. The idea of the visit is torturing him. He fears having to reveal that he is gay – most of all he fears that his partner, Leo, will reveal his sexuality to his father. Pietro, however, has other matters on his mind: he has news of a devastating diagnosis to share with his son. And when his life with Leo unexpectedly collides with his investigation into Michele’s disappearance, it seems that in the complicated web of the small town of Bolzano, the truth behind the mystery cannot hide for long.

His travels take him to Shakespeare & Co in Paris, Wells in Winchester, Green Apple Books in San Francisco, Librairie des Colonnes in Tangier, the Strand Book Store in New York and provoke encounters with thinkers, poets, dreamers, revolutionaries and readers.

School Blues,"Daniel Pennac has never forgotten what it was like to be a very unsatisfactory student, nor the day one of his teachers saved his life by assigning him the task of writing a novel. This was the moment Pennac realized that no-one has to be a failure for ever. In School Blues, Pennac explores the many facets of schooling: how fear makes children reject education; how children can be captivated by inventive thinking; how consumerism has altered attitudes to learning. Haunted by memories of his own turbulent time in the classroom, Pennac enacts dialogues with his teachers, his parents and his own students, and serves up much more than a bald analysis of how young people are consistently failed by a faltering system. School Blues is not only universally applicable, but it is unquestionably a work of literature in its own right, driven by subtlety, sensitivity and a passion for pedagogy, while embracing the realities of contemporary culture.",9780857387646.0,2011-08-04,"['Biography & True Stories', 'Memoirs']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/daniel-pennac/school-blues/9780857387646/,Daniel Pennac

A series of unlikely coincidences led to the appointment of Wallenberg, by trade a poultry importer, as Sweden’s Special Envoy to Budapest in 1944. With remarkable bravery, Wallenberg created a system of protective passports, and sheltered thousands of desperate Jews in buildings he claimed were Swedish libraries and research institutes. As the war drew to a close, his invaluable work almost complete, Wallenberg voluntarily went to meet with the Soviet troops who were relieving the city. Arrested as a spy, Wallenberg disappeared into the depths of the Soviet system, never to be seen again.

All Things Consoled,"Winner of the 2018 Hilary Weston Writers’ Trust Award for Non-fiction A poignant, complex and hugely resonant memoir about the shift from being a daughter to a guardian and caregiver, by a prizewinning author. From Elizabeth Hay, one of Canada’s most celebrated novelists, comes a startling and beautiful memoir about the drama of her parents’ end, and the longer drama of being their daughter. Jean and Gordon Hay were a formidable pair. She was an artist and superlatively frugal; he was a proud and principled schoolteacher with an explosive temper. Elizabeth, the so-called difficult child, always suspected she would end up caring for them in their final years, in part to atone for her childhood sins. Philip Roth once said, “Old age is a massacre”. All Things Consoled takes you inside the massacre as Hay’s ferociously independent parents become increasingly dependent on her. With remarkable wit and honesty, Hay lays bare the agony of a family coping as old age turns into the tragedy of living too long. In the end she arrives at a more nuanced understanding of her mother and father, and of herself as their daughter. They were and remain the two vivid giants in her life.",9780857059147.0,2019-08-22,"['Biography & True Stories', 'Memoirs']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/elizabeth-hay/all-things-consoled/9780857059147/,Elizabeth Hay

But local leaders have reason to resist a shift to temperance over alcohol. Jussi, the young Sami boy Læstadius has rescued from destitution and abuse, becomes the preacher’s faithful disciple on long botanical treks to explore the flora and fauna. Læstadius also teaches him to read and write – and to love and fear God. When a milkmaid goes missing deep in the forest, the locals suspect a predatory bear is at large.

Storm Birds,"“A pulse-quickening piece of fiction . . . A terrifying depiction of peril at sea” – Financial Times In February 1959, several Icelandic trawlers were caught in a storm off Newfoundland’s Grand Banks. What happened there is the inspiration for this novel. Not since The Perfect Storm has there been a book which captures the sheer drama and terror of a crisis at sea. Karason is an exceptional storyteller, an Icelandic Erskine Caldwell or William Faulkner. The side trawler Mafurinn is hit by a major storm just as they prepare to turn for home. Thirty-two men aboard, and a hold full of redfish. The sea is cold enough to kill a man in minutes, and the trawler quickly ices up in the biting frost and violent tempest.

The Blind Spot,"An essential collection of literary criticism by one of Spain’s most acclaimed authors Javier Cercas is one of the most enjoyable and innovative novelists at work today. Well known among English-language readers as the author of Soldiers of Salamis (winner of the Independent Foreign Fictio Prize), The Anatomy of a Moment and The Impostor, Cercas is also Professor of Spanish Literature at the University of Girona. In 2015, following in the footsteps of George Steiner, Mario Vargas Llosa and Umberto Eco, as Weidenfeld Visiting Professor in Comparative European Literature at St Anne’s College, Oxford, Cercas gave a series of five lectures on the novel today, which have since been revised and are now published in English for the first time as The Blind Spot. Starting with Don Quixote and his own experience as a writer, Cercas launches out into a consideration of the most challenging fiction of the last hundred years, from Kafka, Borges, Perec, Calvino and Kundera, to Sebald, Coetzee, Barnes, Foster Wallace and Knausgård. First, he defines and celebrates certain aspects of the novel in the twenty-first century which are also features of Cervantes’ masterpiece: its essential irony and ambiguity, its total commitment to innovation, its natural, joyful",9780857056559.0,2018-05-03,"['Literary Essays', 'Prose: Non-fiction', 'Literature & Literary Studies']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/javier-cercas/the-blind-spot/9780857056559/,Javier Cercas
Damned Good Show,"They joined an R.A.F. known as ‘the best flying club in the world’, but when war pitches the young pilots of 409 Squadron into battle over Germany, their training, tactics and equipment are soon found wanting, their twin-engined bombers obsolete from the off. Chances of completing a 30-operation tour? One in three. At best. Robinson’s crooked salute to the dogged heroes of the R.A.F.’s early bombing campaign is a wickedly humourous portrait of men doing their duty in flying death traps, fully aware, in those dark days of war, there was nothing else to do but dig in and hang on.",9780857385604.0,2011-10-01,"['Modern & Contemporary Fiction (post C 1945)', 'Fiction & Related Items']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/derek-robinson-4/damned-good-show/9780857385604/,Derek Robinson
Sanctuary,"THE NEW AWARD-WINNING INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER BY THE AUTHOR OF THE MOUNTAIN “Can be compared (with no fear of hyperbole) to Stephen King and Jo Nesbø” – Massimo Vincenz, La Repubblica. “D’Andrea piles on the action and the atmosphere with the panache of a seasoned writer” Marcel Berlins, The Times. Marlene Wegener is on the run. She has stolen something from her husband, something priceless, irreplaceable. But she doesn’t get very far. When her car veers off a bleak midwinter road she takes refuge in the remote home of Simon Keller, a tough mountain man who lives alone with his demons. Here in her high mountain sanctuary, she begins to rekindle a sense of herself: tough, capable, no longer the trophy on a gangster’s arm. But Herr Wegener does not know how to forgive, and in his rage he makes a pact with the devil. The Trusted Man.

The Sorrow of Angels,"It is three weeks since the boy came to town, carrying a book of poetry to return to the old sea captain – the poetry that did for his friend Bárður. Three weeks, but already Bárður’s ghost has faded. Snow falls so heavily that it binds heaven and earth together. As the villagers gather in the inn to drink schnapps and coffee while the boy reads to them from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Jens the postman stumbles in half dead, having almost frozen to his horse. On his next journey to the wide open fjords he is accompanied by the boy, and both must risk their lives for each other, and for an unusual item of mail. The Sorrow of Angels is a timeless literary masterpiece; in extraordinarily powerful language it brings the struggle between man and nature tangibly to life.

Bees and Their Keepers,"With deep knowledge and a sharp wit, Lotte Möller unfolds our understanding of bees and bee lore from antiquity to the present. A beekeeper herself, she gives insight into the activity in the hive and describes the bees’ natural order and habits. She explores the myths of the past, and how and when they were replaced by fact. For example, the heated discussions that broke out in the eighteenth century when it was discovered that the hive was ruled by a queen, not a king as had been the belief since Aristotle. In her travels Möller encounters a host of colourful characters, from a trigger-happy Californian beekeeper raging against both killer bees and bee politics, to the warring beekeepers on the island of Læso and Brother Adam of Buckfast Abbey, breeder of the Buckfast queen now popular throughout Europe and beyond. Bees and Their Keepers is a compelling cultural history for the beekeeper and general reader alike.

But in the bloodiest year of a bloody war, how will she find one body among thousands? For Tariq, this is more than just a marriage of convenience: the beautiful, urbane Qisma must be his, body and soul. But can a sheikh steeped in genteel tradition share a tranquil bed with a modern Iraqi woman? The President has been deposed, and the garden of Iraq is full of presidents who will stop at nothing to take his place. Qisma is afraid – afraid for her son, afraid that it is only a matter of time before her father’s murderers come for her. The only way to survive is to take a slice of Iraq for herself. But ambition is the most dangerous drug of all, and it could just seal Qisma’s fate.

All Things Consoled,"Winner of the 2018 Hilary Weston Writers’ Trust Award for Non-fiction A poignant, complex and hugely resonant memoir about the shift from being a daughter to a guardian and caregiver, by a prizewinning author. From Elizabeth Hay, one of Canada’s most celebrated novelists, comes a startling and beautiful memoir about the drama of her parents’ end, and the longer drama of being their daughter. Jean and Gordon Hay were a formidable pair. She was an artist and superlatively frugal; he was a proud and principled schoolteacher with an explosive temper. Elizabeth, the so-called difficult child, always suspected she would end up caring for them in their final years, in part to atone for her childhood sins. Philip Roth once said, “Old age is a massacre”. All Things Consoled takes you inside the massacre as Hay’s ferociously independent parents become increasingly dependent on her. With remarkable wit and honesty, Hay lays bare the agony of a family coping as old age turns into the tragedy of living too long.

The Lost and the Damned,"A suspenseful new police procedural from a former French police officer and one of the original writers on the hit series Spiral A corpse that wakes up on the mortuary slab. A case of spontaneous human combustion. There is little by the way of violent crime and petty theft that Capitaine Victor Coste has not encountered in his fifteen years on the St Denis patch – but nothing like this. Though each crime has a logical explanation, something unusual is afoot all the same, and Coste is about to be dragged out of his comfort zone. Anonymous letters addressed to him personally have begun to arrive, highlighting the fates of two women, invisible victims whose deaths were never explained. Just two more blurred faces among the ranks of the lost and the damned. Olivier Norek’s first novel draws on all his experience as a police officer in one of France’s toughest suburbs – the same experience he drew on as a writer for the hit TV series Spiral.

Letters To Poseidon,"‘I had been looking for someone to write to for a long time, but how does a man write letters to a god?’ From his Mediterranean garden on the island of Menorca, Cees Nooteboom writes to the trident-wielding deity, Poseidon, ‘initiating a dialogue not only with the past,’ as Alberto Manguel observes in his Preface, ‘but with an entire world that seemed lost for ever.’ Offering a seductive interweaving of keen observation and the fruits of a vast knowledge, Nooteboom explores questions of human existence through the minutiae of the living world around him, and marvels at the secrets of the deep. He recalls figures in history, places he has travelled to, objets trouvés, works of art and literature, and takes a fresh look at the ancient myths. At once playful and poignant, beautiful and bizarre, Nooteboom’s Letters to Poseidon are couched in the glittering prose of one of Europe’s outstanding stylists.",9781782066194.0,2014-11-06,"['Biography & True Stories', 'Memoirs']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/cees-nooteboom/letters-to-poseidon/9781782066194/,Cees Nooteboom

Before long, Will has been plunged headlong into the life of Madeleine’s great love, his longlost grandfather, Henry Latymer.

The Tree of the Toraja,"A middle-aged filmmaker visits Indonesia and becomes entranced by the Toraja custom of interning the bodies of very young deceased children in the trunks of trees. In time, the trunk heals, encasing and protecting the tiny bodies as the tree grows slowly heavenwards. On his return to France, the filmmaker receives news that his dearest friend is dying of cancer, prompting a reflection on the part death occupies in our existence, our inability to confront our mortality and our struggle to conceive of a happy life after a devastating loss. For the Toraja, dying is a central part of being alive. Death is at the forefront of their culture, unlike the western preference for keeping death firmly in the shadows, unacknowledged until it begins to really breathe down your neck and simply cannot be ignored; a taboo subject to be feared and resented. Like the trees of the Toraja, this powerful novel encloses and preserves memories of lost loves and friendships, and contains the promise of rebirth and rebuilding, even after a terrible tragedy.",9780857057709.0,2018-07-26,"['Modern & Contemporary Fiction (post C 1945)', 'Fiction & Related Items']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/philippe-claudel-2/the-tree-of-the-toraja/9780857057709/,Philippe Claudel

But one sunny afternoon, when she was nine years old, a strange man followed her home and raped her in the stairwell of her building.

It charts – among many other social developments – the appearance of new political parties and independent trade unions, the rapid evolution of mass media, the emergence of a new class of entrepreneurs, a new openness about sex and pornography and a sudden craze for hot-air ballooning, banned under the Communist regime. 1990 is a reminder of the confusion and aspirations of the year before Communism finally collapsed in Russia, and a tantalising glimpse of the paths that may have been taken if Yeltsin’s coup had not forced the issue in 1991.",9780857052025.0,2013-03-28,"['History: Specific Events & Topics', 'History', 'Humanities']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/arch-tait/1990/9780857052025/,"['Irina Prokhorova', 'Arch Tait']"

What’s more, in this novel, she has impeccable syntactic control, and her ear is sharper than ever before” Valeria Luiselli, Guernica A shy young Mexican woman moves to Paris to study literature. Cecilia has few friends, and a morbid fascination with watching the funerals taking place in Père-Lachaise cemetery outside her apartment. She suddenly strikes up a close relationship with her neighbour, a sickly young man who shares her interest in death and believes we can communicate with the dead. After coming to entirely depend on him for company and routine, Cecilia is left devastated by his decision to go to Sicily for his health, and is left alone in an unfriendly city once more. Claudio, meanwhile, lives in New York with the submissive, quiet, but very wealthy Ruth. She makes few demands of him, while acquiescing to all his desires and indulging his obsessive, misogynistic nature. He meets Cecilia by chance when visiting a friend in Paris and their two very different worlds collide with transformative consequences.",9780857055118.0,2018-03-08,"['Fiction In Translation', 'Fiction & Related Items', 'Fiction: Special Features']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/guadalupe-nettel/after-the-winter/9780857055118/,Guadalupe Nettel

The Last Days of El Comandante,"Venezuela 2012: The President’s illness casts a shadow over the lives of his citizens – he divides opinion, but life without him is almost unimaginable. Miguel Sanabria is a retired oncologist, ambivalent towards the President but caught between a virulently anti-Chávez wife and a equally vehement pro-Chávez brother. He is asked by his nephew to hide a mobile phone carrying secret footage that could shed new light on the President’s condition. His neighbour Fredy has found a fresh angle for a new book about Chávez, but to take advantage he must agree to a “green-card” marriage and leave his girlfriend and their son for two months, even as their landlady plots to repossess their home. In another apartment live nine-year-old María and her neurotic, near-agoraphobic mother. Taken out of school to be educated at home, María turns to internet chat rooms for company, while her mother’s fears about the city’s endemic violence are proved tragically prescient. The fates and fortunes of these neighbours will prove inextricably entwined as the hour of the President’s death draws ever closer.

The Little Girl on the Ice Floe,"“Life itself is in these pages: in this candid, poetic style there is storytelling of real quality” – LEILA SLIMANI, author of Lullaby A powerful and personal account of the devastating consequences of childhood rape: a valuable voice for the #MeToo conversation. Adélaïde Bon grew up in a wealthy neighborhood in Paris, a privileged child with a loving family, lots of friends and seemingly limitless opportunity lying ahead of her. But one sunny afternoon, when she was nine years old, a strange man followed her home and raped her in the stairwell of her building. She told her parents, they took her to the police, the fact of the crime was registered … and then a veil was quietly drawn over that part of her childhood, and life was supposed to go on. Except, of course, it didn’t. Throughout her adolescence and young adulthood, Adélaïde struggles with the aftermath of the horror of that afternoon in 1990. The lingering trauma pervades all aspects of her life: family education, friendships, relationships, even her ability to eat normally. And then one day, many years later, when she is married and has a small son, she receives a call from the police saying",9780857059574.0,2019-04-18,"['Biography & True Stories', 'Memoirs']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/ad%c3%a9la%c3%afde-bon/the-little-girl-on-the-ice-floe/9780857059574/,Adélaïde Bon
Bees and Their Keepers,"A beautifully illustrated and thoroughly engaging cultural history of beekeeping – packed with anecdote, humour and enriching historical detail. The perfect gift. “A charming look at the history of beekeeping, from myth and folklore to our practical relationship with bees” Gardens Illustrated Beekeeper and garden historian Lotte Möller explores the activities inside and outside the hive while charting the bees’ natural order and habits. With a light touch she uses her encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject to shed light on humanity’s understanding of bees and bee lore from antiquity to the present. A humorous debunking of the myths that have held for centuries is matched by a wry exploration of how and when they were replaced by fact. In her travels Möller encounters a trigger-happy Californian beekeeper raging against both killer bees and bee politics, warring beekeepers on the Danish island of Læso, and Brother Adam of Buckfast Abbey, breeder of the Buckfast queen now popular throughout Europe and beyond, as well a host of others as passionate as she about the complex world of apiculture both past and present.

Why 1914?,"Short, brisk and highly readable, this account stands out from the flood of books written for the Centenary of the Great War. In Why 1914?, Derek Robinson – trained as a historian, shortlisted for the Booker Prize – applies his novelist’s skills to asking how and why Europe hurried into such a massive disaster. He captures a world of kings and Kaisers, generals and infantrymen. None of them knew what a big European war meant. All the combatant nations assumed it would be short, and each expected to win. The roots of such folly began in the nineteenth century. Robinson traces the earliest warning signs, leading to a sudden crisis and an impulsive war that went massively wrong from the start.

In sixty-three elusive episodes we roam freely across the countryside of Lorraine, North-East France, from kitchen to farm to a lover’s bed.

The Day My Grandfather Was a Hero,"“This is a beautiful book, a masterpiece of brevity and depth” New European “This tense novella builds to a final reckoning” The Times In October 1944, a thirteen-year-old girl arrives in a tiny farming community in Lower Austria, at some distance from the main theatre of war. She remembers very little about how she got there, it seems she has suffered trauma from bombardment. One night a few months later, a young, emaciated Russian appears, a deserter from forced labour in the east. He has nothing with him but a canvas roll, which he guards like a hawk. Their burgeoning friendship is abruptly interrupted by the arrival of a group of Wehrmacht soldiers in retreat, who commandeer the farm. Paulus Hochgatterer’s intensely atmospheric, resonant novel is like a painting in itself, a beautiful observation of small shifts from apathy in a community not directly affected by the war, but exhausted by it nonetheless; individual acts of moral bravery which to some extent have the power to change the course of history. Longlisted for the Austrian Book Prize 2017, this subtle, evocative novella will appeal to readers of Hubert Mingarelli’s A MEAL IN WINTER and Jenny Erpenbeck’s THE END OF DAYS.",9780857059499.0,2020-07-23,"['Modern & Contemporary Fiction (post C 1945)', 'Fiction & Related Items']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/paulus-hochgatterer/the-day-my-grandfather-was-a-hero/9780857059499/,Paulus Hochgatterer

As the pursuit goes on, and the pursuers are struck by a shattering discovery, Gartsev confronts both the worst within himself and the tantalising prospect of another, totally different life.

The Photographer at Sixteen,"“A truly remarkable book about identity, image and memory. It is fiercely compelling” EDMUND DE WAAL, author of The Hare with the Amber Eyes A poet’s memoir of his mother that flows backwards through time, and through a tumultuous period of European history – a tender and yet unsparing autobiographical journey. In July 1975, George Szirtes’ mother, Magda, died in an ambulance, on her way to hospital after attempting to take her own life. She was fifty-one years old. This memoir is an attempt to make sense of what came before, to re-construct who Magda Szirtes really was. The Photographer at Sixteen moves from her death, spooling backwards through her years as a mother, through sickness and exile in England, the family’s flight from Hungary in 1956, her time in two concentration camps, her girlhood as an ambitious photographer and her vanished family in Transylvania. The woman who emerges, fleetingly, fragmentarily – with her absolutism, her contradictions, her beauty – is utterly captivating. What were the terrors and obsessions that drove her? The Photographer at Sixteen reveals a life that is at Magda Szirtes from the depths of the end to the comparable safety of the photographer’s studio where she",9780857058522.0,2019-01-31,"['Biography & True Stories', 'Memoirs']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/george-szirtes/the-photographer-at-sixteen/9780857058522/,George Szirtes

It’s Christmas in Culiacán and Detective Edgar “Lefty” Mendieta can’t believe his luck. An old flame has returned with a teenage son he knew nothing about. Happiness seems to finally beckon for our careworn hero. The only snag is that Jason Mendieta wants to follow in his father’s footsteps-even as Mexico’s drug war descends a slippery slope toward chaos. While Lefty pursues a lunatic who has taken to bumping off dentists with a heavy-calibre pistol, a secret agent infiltrates a meeting of the drug lords and hears Pacific Cartel boss Samantha Valdés implore her underlings to stay out of the war. But an audacious murder provokes Samantha to change her mind and launch a wave of grisly killings across the country. Samantha then persuades Lefty to help her find the killer that pushed her over the edge. The truth he discovers will underline an old adage: revenge is a dish best served cold.

After taking a bullet to the head, Salander is under close supervision in Intensive Care, and is set to face trial for three murders and one attempted murder on her eventual release.

On Beauty,"Sumptuously illustrated and fascinatingly written – a vast store of wisdom about the nature of beauty itself. On Beauty is neither a history of art, nor a history of aesthetics, but Umberto Eco draws on both these disciplines to define the ideas of beauty that have informed us from the classical world to modern times. In terms of form and style, On Beauty has been conceived for a vast and diverse readership. Packed with examples from painting, sculpture, architecture, film, photography, the decorative arts and literature, it offers a rich and intelligent panorama of this huge subject. “Eco is one of the most influential thinkers of our time” Los Angeles Times In On Beauty Eco is at his most captivating and eclectic: we read not only of Botticelli and Michelangelo but of how much the fashion of the 1960s owes to ancient Egyptian dress, and how ancient Roman and eighteenth-century hairstyles have much in common. It makes the familiar new, and sheds a brilliant light on the unfamiliar. On Beauty is illustrated in full colour throughout and produced to the highest standards.

In Ringo’s Barcelona, life endures in the shadow of civil war – the Fascist regime oversees all. Inspired by glimpses of Hollywood glamour, he finds his own form of resistance, escaping into myths of his own making, recast as a heroic cowboy or an intrepid big-game hunter. But when he finds himself inveigled as a go-between into an affair far beyond his juvenile comprehension, he is forced to turn from his interior world and unleash his talent for invention on the lives of others. And all the while he is left to wonder – what could have happened to Señora Mir that day to send her so far beyond the edge of reason? The Calligraphy of Dreams is a luminescent coming-of-age novel with a devilish twist.

Three Days and a Life,"LONGLISTED FOR THE CWA INTERNATIONAL DAGGER 2018 Antoine is twelve years old. His parents are divorced and he lives with his mother in Beauval, a small, backwater town surrounded by forests, where everyone knows everyone’s business, and nothing much ever happens. But in the last days of 1999, a series of events unfolds, culminating in the shocking vanishing without trace of a young child. The adults of the town are at a loss to explain the disappearance, but for Antoine, it all begins with the violent death of his neighbour’s dog. From that one brutal act, his fate and the fate of his neighbour’s six year old son are bound forever. In the years following Rémi’s disappearance, Antoine wrestles with the role his actions played. As a seemingly inescapable net begins to tighten, breaking free from the suffocating environs of Beauval becomes a gnawing obsession. But how far does he have to run, and how long will it take before his past catches up with him again?

To Cook a Bear,"“An original and gripping crime story” THE TIMES “Niemi succeeds in constructing a story that works as a murder mystery and as a compelling study of a dangerously inward-looking community” SUNDAY TIMES “A riveting, psychologically astute mystery . . . It is not to be missed” BOOKLIST It is 1852, and in Sweden’s far north, deep in the Arctic Circle, charismatic preacher and Revivalist Lars Levi Læstadius impassions a poverty-stricken congregation with visions of salvation. But local leaders have reason to resist a shift to temperance over alcohol. Jussi, the young Sami boy Læstadius has rescued from destitution and abuse, becomes the preacher’s faithful disciple on long botanical treks to explore the flora and fauna. Læstadius also teaches him to read and write – and to love and fear God. When a milkmaid goes missing deep in the forest, the locals suspect a predatory bear is at large. A second girl is attacked, and the sheriff is quick to offer a reward for the bear’s capture. Using early forensics and daguerreotype, Læstadius and Jussi find clues that point to a far worse killer on the loose, even as they are unaware of the evil closing in around them.

John Law,"At the summit of his power, John Law was the most famous man in Europe. Born in Scotland in 1671, he was convicted of murder in London and, after his escape from prison, fled Scotland for the mainland when Union with England brought with it a warrant for his arrest. On the continent he lurched from one money-making scheme to the next – selling insurance against losing lottery tickets in Holland, advising the Duke of Savoy – amassing a fortune of some £80,000. But for his next trick he had grander ambitions. When Louis XIV died, leaving a thoroughly bankrupt France to his five-year-old heir, Law gained the ear of the Regent, Philippe D’Orleans. In the years that followed, Law’s financial wizardry transformed the fortunes of France, enriching speculators and investors across the continent, and he was made Controller-General of Finances, effectively becoming the French Prime Minister. But the fall from grace that was to follow was every bit as spectacular as his meteoric rise. John Law, by a biographer of Adam Smith and the author of Frozen Desire and Capital of the Mind, dramatises the life of one of the most inventive financiers in history, a man who was",9781848666078.0,2018-09-06,"['Biography & True Stories', 'Biography: General']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/james-buchan/john-law/9781848666078/,James Buchan
Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa,"Shortlised for the Saltire Society Non Fiction Book of the Year Award Almost every adult and child is familiar with his Treasure Island, but few know that Robert Louis Stevenson lived out his last years on an equally remote island, which was squabbled over by colonial powers much as Captain Flint’s treasure was contested by the mongrel crew of the Hispaniola. In 1890 Stevenson settled in Upolu, an island in Samoa, after two years sailing round the South Pacific. He was given a Samoan name and became a fierce critic of the interference of Germany, Britain and the U.S.A. in Samoan affairs – a stance that earned him Oscar Wilde’s sneers, and brought him into conflict with the Colonial Office, who regarded him as a menace and even threatened him with expulsion from the island. Joseph Farrell’s pioneering study of Stevenson’s twilight years stands apart from previous biographies by giving as much weight to the Samoa and the Samoans – their culture, their manners, their history – as to the life and work of the man himself. For it is only by examining the full complexity of Samoa and the political situation it faced as the nineteenth century gave way",9781848668829.0,2017-09-01,"['Biography & True Stories', 'Biography: General', 'Biography: Literary']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/joseph-farrell/robert-louis-stevenson-in-samoa/9781848668829/,Joseph Farrell
A Foolish Virgin,"It is the middle of the roaring twenties, and Gittel is living The Hague with her parents, whose blazing rows are the traditional preserve of Sundays and public holidays. What luck, then, that Gittel is Jewish, and must submit to “the double helping of public holidays that is the lot of Jewish families”. After every matrimonial slanging match, Gittel’s mother runs off to her parents’ home in Antwerp – with her daugher in tow. Much to her delight, Gittel makes the acquaintance of the well-to-do Mardell family, who allow her to practise on their Steinway. Gittel feels that she is taken seriously by Mr Mardell, the head of the household, and by thirty-year-old Lucie, whom she adores. When these friendships turn out to be nothing but an illusion, Gittel learns her first lessons about trust and betrayal. Her second comes soon after, when her father, whose talents for business leave much to be desired, attempts to make a quick killing in Berlin on the eve of the Wall Street Crash.

Zola and the Victorians,"London, 1888: Jack the Ripper stalks the streets of Whitechapel; national strikes and social unrest threaten the status quo; a grave economic crisis is spreading across the Atlantic . . . Yet Her Majesty’s government is preoccupied with “a mere book” – or rather, a series of books: new translations of the Rougon-Macquart saga by French literary giant Émile Zola. In his time, Zola made his British contemporaries look positively pastoral; much of his work is considered shocking and transgressive even now. But it was his English publisher who bore the brunt of the Victorians’ moral outrage at Zola’s “realistic” depictions of striking miners, society courtesans and priapic, feuding farmers. Seventy years before Lady Chatterley’s Lover broke the back of British censorship, Henry Vizetelly’s commitment to publishing Zola, and to the nascent principle of free speech, not only landed him in the dock and thereafter in prison, but brought to ruin to the publishing house he had founded. Meanwhile, Zola was going from strength to strength, establishing his reputation as a literary legend and falling in love with a woman half his age.

Treblinka,"Chil Rajchman, a Polish Jew, was arrested with his younger sister in 1942 and sent to Treblinka, a death camp where more than 750,000 were murdered before it was abandoned by German soldiers. His sister was sent to the gas chambers, but Rajchman escaped execution, working for ten months under incessant threats and beatings as a barber, a clothes-sorter, a corpse-carrier, a puller of teeth from those same bodies. In August 1943, there was an uprising at the camp, and Rajchman was among the handful of men who managed to escape. In 1945, he set down this account, a plain, unembellished and exact record of the raw horror he endured every day. This unique testimony, which has remained in the sole possession of his family ever since, has never before been published in English. For its description of unspeakably cruelty, Treblinka is a memoir that will not be superseded. In addition to Rajchman’s account, this volume includes the complete text of Vasily Grossman’s ‘The Hell of Treblinka’, one of the first descriptions of a Nazi extermination camp; a powerful and harrowing piece of journalism written only weeks after the camp was dissolved.

Winds of the Night,"“Perhaps the worst thing about war is the peace that follows . . .” Winds of the Night is the follow-up, published almost thirty years later, to Joan Sales’ acclaimed masterwork of the Spanish Civil War, Uncertain Glory. It describes the shell-shocked wasteland that was post-war Catalonia through the eyes of Cruells, a Republican chaplain who survives the war, and completes his theological studies only to lose his faith in a world where it seems all hope has been extinguished. As he struggles to function as a rural priest, his steps are dogged by a ghostly figures from his past, such as Lamoneda, a fascist agent provocateur who now hobnobs with Himmler and misses few opportunities to turn the febrile post-war atmosphere to his financial advantage. Against his wishes, Creulls is drawn into obsessive dialogues about the war in which only lunacy prevails, for Lamoneda seems to hold the key to the whereabouts of an old friend – the mercurial Juli Soleràs, whose charisma, for all his betrayals, still holds Cruells in thrall.

She dreams in recipes, she’s always imagining food combinations and cooking times, she hunts down elusive flavours and aromas, and she soon usurps the couple’s cook. But for all her genius, the Cheffe remains very secretive about the rest of her life. She becomes pregnant, but will not reveal her daughter’s father. She shares nothing of her feelings or emotions. And when the demands of her work and caring for her child become too much, she leaves her baby in the care of her family, and sets out to open her own restaurant, which will soon win rave reviews and be lauded by all. But her relationship with her daughter will never be easy, and before long, it will threaten to destroy everything the Cheffe has spent her life perfecting.",9780857058911.0,2019-11-14,"['Fiction In Translation', 'Fiction & Related Items', 'Fiction: Special Features']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/marie-ndiaye/the-cheffe/9780857058911/,Marie NDiaye

A chance meeting at a regimental reunion obliges a veteran of the Korean War to confront his past.

The internet search for a book published in 1887, leads a writer to discover the life of a passionate woman.

Grey Bees,"Ukraine’s most famous novelist dramatises the conflict raging in his country through the adventures of a mild-mannered beekeeper. From the author of the bestselling Death and the Penguin. “A latter-day Bulgakov . . . A Ukrainian Murakami” – Phoebe Taplin, Guardian Little Starhorodivka, a village of three streets, lies in Ukraine’s Grey Zone, the no-man’s-land between loyalist and separatist forces. Thanks to the lukewarm war of sporadic violence and constant propaganda that has been dragging on for years, only two residents remain: retired safety inspector turned beekeeper Sergey Sergeyich and Pashka, a “frenemy” from his schooldays. With little food and no electricity, under ever-present threat of bombardment, Sergeyich’s one remaining pleasure is his bees. As spring approaches, he knows he must take them far from the Grey Zone so they can collect their pollen in peace. This simple mission on their behalf introduces him to combatants and civilians on both sides of the battle lines: loyalists, separatists, Russian occupiers and Crimean Tatars. Wherever he goes, Sergeyich’s childlike simplicity and strong moral compass disarm everyone he meets.

"Stieg Larsson, My Friend","Five years after his death, Stieg Larsson is best known as the author of the Millennium Trilogy, but during his career as a journalist he was a crucial protagonist in the battle against racism and for democracy in Sweden, and one of the founders of the anti-facist magazine Expo. Kurdo Baksi first met Larsson in 1992; it was the beginning of an intense friendship, and a fruitful but challenging working relationship. In this candid and rounded memoir, Baksi answers the questions a multitude of Larsson’s fans have already asked, about his upbringing; the recurring death threats; his insomnia and his vices; his feminism – so evident in his books – and his dogmatism. What was he like as a colleague? Who provided the inspiration for his now-immortal characters (Baksi is one of the few who appears in the trilogy as himself)?

Bees and Their Keepers,"A beautifully illustrated and thoroughly engaging cultural history of beekeeping – packed with anecdote, humour and enriching historical detail. The perfect gift. “A charming look at the history of beekeeping, from myth and folklore to our practical relationship with bees” Gardens Illustrated Beekeeper and garden historian Lotte Möller explores the activities inside and outside the hive while charting the bees’ natural order and habits. With a light touch she uses her encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject to shed light on humanity’s understanding of bees and bee lore from antiquity to the present. A humorous debunking of the myths that have held for centuries is matched by a wry exploration of how and when they were replaced by fact. In her travels Möller encounters a trigger-happy Californian beekeeper raging against both killer bees and bee politics, warring beekeepers on the Danish island of Læso, and Brother Adam of Buckfast Abbey, breeder of the Buckfast queen now popular throughout Europe and beyond, as well a host of others as passionate as she about the complex world of apiculture both past and present.

Between the Wars,"At the end of 1918 one prescient American historian began to write a history of the Great War. “What will you call it?” he was asked. “The First World War,” was his bleak response. In Between the Wars Philip Ziegler examines the major international turning points – cultural and social as well as political and military – that led the world from one war to another. His approach is panoramic, touching on all parts of the world where history was being made, examining Gandhi’s March to the Sea and the Chaco War in South America alongside Hitler’s rise to power. It is the tragic story of a world determined that the horrors of the First World War would never be repeated, yet committed to a path which in hindsight was inevitably destined to end in a second, even more devastating conflict. Each chapter bears the unmistakable stamp of Ziegler’s scholarship: a keen eye for the telling anecdote, elegant and fluid prose, and calm and fair judgments. In a world that grows ever more uncertain, its perspective on how hopes of peace can dissolve into the promise of war becomes more relevant with each passing day.",9780857055248.0,2016-10-06,"['History', 'History: Earliest Times To Present Day', '20th Century History: C 1900 To C 2000', 'Humanities']",https://www.maclehosepress.com/titles/philip-ziegler/between-the-wars/9780857055248/,Philip Ziegler

For the many years have left certain indelible wounds. During his service, the fool has been the king’s closest counsel, his most trusted companion and adviser, privy to the king’s deepest secrets and most intimate thoughts. It is an honoured position for which many other courtiers would pay a hefty price. Something the fool understands only too well, for this closeness has indeed come at a terrible cost. What price the confidence of a great king? Is it stories, jokes, witty repartee? Or does the debt fall closer to home?
