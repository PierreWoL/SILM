Death on the installment plan.,"First American edition. A French writer and doctor, Louis-Ferdinand Destouches (1894-1961) adopted the pseudonym Céline when he wrote his first novel, Voyage au bout de la nuit. He here looks back on his Paris childhood, depicting the tale of a young boy struggling with his parents and life. These first two novels are a nihilistic vision of human suffering, failure and pessimism. Céline wrote three virulently anti-Semitic pamphlets between 1937 and 1941, and after WWII was accused of Nazi collaboration. He fled France to live in Germany, joining members of the Vichy Government and other French collaborators. While there, he treated refugees of the regime. Convicted in absentia in a civil court in France to one year of imprisonment and declared a national disgrace, Céline did not return to France until after his pardon in 1951. Céline’s later works were badly received, as his reputation as a writer had been shadowed his anti-Semitism and anti-Communism. He is now generally regarded as one of the most important and influential, as well as controversial, twentieth century French novelists.","Little, Brown and Company,","['Louis-Ferdinand CÉLINE', 'CÉLINE, Louis-Ferdinand']",USD,350.0,InStock,FIRST AMERICAN EDITION.

Etat de la medecine ancienne et moderne avec un plan pour perfectionner celle-ci...,"First edition in French.

The last section contains the author's plan for improving the work; perhaps the reason for the blanks bound into the book. Of interest is Clifton's comparison of ancient and modern medical practices, raising issues such as why the ancients used bathing and exercise so much more than the moderns. Among his many topics, Clifton relates the need for observation, and discusses materia medica, methods of cure, and inoculations. In addition, he here states that Hippocrates had anticipated Newton in his idea of the system of gravitation. . Clifton (d. 1736) received degrees from Oxford, Leiden and Cambridge. He was a successful physician who practiced in London, physician to the Prince of Wales, and a Fellow of the College of Physicians and the Royal Society.

"The history of the heavens, considered according to the notions of the poets and philosophers, compared with the doctrines of Moses.","First edition in English of Histoire du ciel consideré selon les idées des poëts, des philosophes, et de Moïse (Paris, 1739), a rare and interesting treatise on the perception, both ancient and modern, of the universe, the creation, and the superiority of Moses’ cosmogony. In attempting to make modern science conform to Genesis, Pluche basically refutes the entire range of speculation on the origin of the world which conflicts with Mosaic cosmogony. In displaying the excellence of the physics of Moses, which supposedly conforms to the teachings of both history and experimental physics, he carefully explains his opposition theories proposed by those physicists which he termed “romans philosophiques.” He even includes an in-depth discussion of Newton’s work. The plates illustrate numerous Egyptian, Roman, and Greek mythological symbols. Many are signed by the popular Paris engraver, Jacques Phillippe Le Bas (1707-1783). Pluche (1688-1761), a teacher of humanities and rhetoric, was the leading French popularizer of natural theology. A controversial professor of rhetoric at Rheims, he became tutor in physics to, among others, the Earl of Stafford’s son. His most famous work, Spectacle de la nature (1732), was immensely popular as a text on both the Continent and in England, but brought","J.

Six discourses delivered before the Royal....,"First edition. This is a valuable work for the history of science of the period. It includes Davy's lectures from 1820-26 during his term as president of the Royal Society. It also contains the presentations of the Royal and Copley Medals to the great names in science, including Herschel, Sabine, Arago, Barlow, Dalton, and others. The publishing history of this work is of special interest. Charles Babbage accused Davy of extracting funds from the Royal Society to line his own pocket. Babbage's charges were answered by the author's brother, John Davy, in a letter to the editors of Philosophical Magazine: \""Davy received 500 guineas for the copyright of the work from Murray, and only 850 copies were printed. The questionable financial arrangement was the purchase of 500 copies by the Royal Society . . . ‘Phil. Trans.' for 1827 (at the Royal Society Library) has been bound with the Discourses; a half dozen or so other copies that I have seen in scattered libraries do not have the Discourses so bound\"" (Fulmer).","John Murray,","['Davy, Sir Humphrey', 'Sir Humphrey Davy']",USD,950.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION.

Murray’s book most notably recounts his three months spent in the American wild among a group of traveling Pawnee Indians. “This is the first and best edition of a most interesting work, by an intelligent observer of the peculiarities of the Pawnees, before they had been modified by contact with the whites” (Sabin). Murray also records at length the scenery of the Hudson River and points north during an important moment in history for this region. By the mid-1830’s, upstate New York and areas of New England had experienced a huge surge in tourism, in no small part due to the ingenious paintings of the Hudson River School artists and the sense of national pride and interest in the sublime they elicited; a mixed blessing indeed as more interest meant more crowds and destruction of the idyllic landscape. Murray includes descriptions of the new railway system brought to the area, as well as his encounter of “Mr. Cooper the American novelist” on a steamboat going up the Hudson! Murray (1806–1895) was known as a rather striking figure in English society, and he seems to have led a rather fascinating life.

"Five weeks in a balloon; or, journeys and discoveries in Africa.","First edition in English of Jules Verne’s first novel following the first French edition issued in 1863. This copy is also the first of the author’s works published in America. The publisher’s note decribes the book as a “satire on English books on African travel” and noting that while the descriptions of “the geography, the inhabitants, the animals and features of the countries” are accurate, the mode of transportation and the adventures are fictious. Verne’s Five Weeks in a Balloon was his first novel combining scientific text and adventure fiction and soon became an international bestseller. This English edition additionally contains finely engraved illustrations depicting the protagonists’ epic journey. Verne (1828–1905) was a French author and considered the father of modern science fiction. Five Weeks in a Balloon launched what is known as his “positivist period” along with his other hugely popular novels like Journey to the centre of the Earth and Twenty thousand leagues under the sea.","D.

Crania Helvetica.,"First edition of this elaborate and valuable contribution to ancient and modern crania, and vertebrate paleozoology. With the publication of Darwin's Origin in 1859 and its inescapable implication that living and fossil species are linked by a common phylogeny, the primate fossil took on a new significance for documenting human genealogy in earlier epochs. Thus, in the 1860's, the fossil record of primates was only a potential source of evidence relevant to the theory of evolution. Rutimeyer (1825-1895) was Professor of zoology, comparative anatomy, and one of the most celebrated palaeontologists in the domain of fossil mammalia. With the tremendous advances in the discovery of new primate species, Rutimeyer was the first to recognized fossil prosimian. It was at this time that physical anthropology started to develop as an independent direction of research, and the need for standardization of techniques was evident. For the measurement of the skull, the use of the horizontal plane line was drawn through the nasal spine and center of the auditory meatus. It was in the present work that the horizontal plane was defined. His (1831-1904) created the science of histogenesis, or the study of the embryonic origins of different types of animal tissue.

De l’infini mathematique,"First edition of the author’s most notable work on quantitative formalisation or quantification. In this, his doctoral thesis, Couturat explains that the concepts of number and quantity are independent of one another and that both are independent of experience. He presents a vigorous case on behalf of an actual infinite at a time when the majority of French philosophers, led by Charles Renouvier, were resolute advocates of finitism. In opposition to the formalist theories of number of Julius Dedekind, Leopold Kronecker, and Hermann Helmholtz, he bases number on magnitude. “His reasoning consisted of offering the actual infinite as a new generalization of number, analogous to those that resulted in signed numbers, fractions, irrationals, and imaginaries. All of these numbers at first seemed to be arithmetical nonsense, but they took on meaning once they were recognized as suitable for representing new magnitudes and for allowing various operations on them that were hitherto impossible. The justification for infinite numbers is that they are indispensable for maintaining the continuity of magnitudes” (see Couturat, Encyclopedia.com). Couturat (1868-1914) was a French logician and mathematician, who “sought a universal language and symbolic language-system to study history of philosophy and the philosophy of mathematics.” He studied at","Felix Alcan,","['Louis COUTURAT', 'COUTURAT, Louis']",USD,450.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION.

Maclaurin (1698-1746), a leading mathematician, natural philosopher, and friend of Newton who was appointed to his chair of mathematics at Edinburgh on Newton's recommendation, introduced a method of generating conics named in his honor. He is also renowned for his proof that a homogeneous liquid mass revolving uniformly around an axis under the action of gravity must assume an ellipsoid form of revolution.","Printed for the author's children,","['Colin MACLAURIN', 'MACLAURIN, Colin']",USD,2500.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION.

Etat de la medecine ancienne et moderne avec un plan pour perfectionner celle-ci...,"First edition in French. This fine work on the history of medicine, originally published in 1732, is divided into five sections, starting from the Greeks (heavier on Hippocrates), to the Romans, and to Arab practitioners through the Restoration, and on to the present time (with an emphasis on English medicine, especially Sydenham and Harvey). The last section contains the author's plan for improving the work; perhaps the reason for the blanks bound into the book. Of interest is Clifton's comparison of ancient and modern medical practices, raising issues such as why the ancients used bathing and exercise so much more than the moderns. Among his many topics, Clifton relates the need for observation, and discusses materia medica, methods of cure, and inoculations. In addition, he here states that Hippocrates had anticipated Newton in his idea of the system of gravitation. . Clifton (d. 1736) received degrees from Oxford, Leiden and Cambridge. He was a successful physician who practiced in London, physician to the Prince of Wales, and a Fellow of the College of Physicians and the Royal Society. He wrote on physiology and medical history, including translating Hippocrates into English. He ultimately left London for Jamaica where he lived until","Quillau,","['CLIFTON, F.

Treves first met Merrick while still a medical student, and it was years later when he was head surgeon at London Hospital that he was to help him; Treves published two papers on Merrick in the British Medical Journal. He later served as physician during the Boer War, for which he was knighted by King Edward VII, who was the subject of Treves’ most famous surgery. Shortly after the war, Treves abandoned his medical practice to become a writer.

According to DSB, Galileo “transformed [the device] from a simple device of limited use to an elaborate calculating instrument of varied uses and of great practical utility by adding to it a number of supplementary scales.

"Observations, relative chiefly to picturesque beauty, made in the year 1772, on several parts of England; particularly the mountains, and lakes of Cumberland, and Westmoreland.","Third edition of this significant work by Gilpin that considerably influenced the development of the concept of “picturesque moment.” This travelogue and observations on the beauty of the Scottish landscape, particularly in Cumberland and Westmoreland, was written fifteen years prior to the publication of the first edition in 1789. The two volume set is part of a larger collection of Gilpin’s travel journals and sketches of the British landscape. Gilpin shows his talent for picturesque description in words, paying particular attention to British ruins and thus establishing a romantic appreciation for such British landmarks such as Scaleby Castle. “With this work, and the others in his Observations series, he successfully laid the initial ground work for aesthetic perception for the next generation of picturesque artists and writers” (DAH). The aquatint plates, by Joseph Farrington, heighten the importance of this work in the beginnings of the picturesque movement: “Indeed Mr. Farrington’s prints render any other portraits of the lakes unnecessary. They are by far, in the author’s opinion, the most accurate, and beautiful views of that romantic country, which he hath seen” (preface, p. xxvii).

Tabularum geographicarum contractum libri quinque,"Bertius’ Tabularum geographicarum was the finest and most important edition of the Caert thresoor, Barent Langenes’ miniature atlas first published in 1598. Langenes (fl. 1598-1610) was a publisher in Middelburg and most likely the author of the text of the well-known and popular work that set the standard for the miniature atlas. Bertius’ revised Latin text and Ptolemaic arrangement first appeared in 1600 and remained influential throughout the following century. All of the maps are up to date, and of particular interest is the fact that the text is geared toward the specific maps as opposed to reciting general information. The fifth part of the present edition features 15 maps devoted to America, including Mexico, Cuba and Jamaica, the Yucatan, Hispaniola, Peru and Brazil, among others. Bertius (1565-1629) grew up in Beveren in Flanders and as a young man traveled widely in Europe. He moved to Amsterdam as a refugee from religious persecution, and after completing his education became a professor of mathematics and librarian at Leyden University. In 1618 he moved to Paris and became official cosmographer to Louis XIII. He was related by marriage to Jodocus Hondius and Pieter van den Keere.

"Synoptic tables of chemistry, intended to serve as a summary of the lectures delivered on that science in the public schools at Paris.","First English edition of this scarce and handsome set of Fourcroy’s chemistry tables. The present work was translated by William Nicholson from the original French (Tableaux Synoptiques de Chimie, 1800), the first set of chemical synoptic tables ever published. The author intended for it to accompany his collected lectures and chief work, Systême des connaissances chimiques (1800), which Ferguson considers “the best account of the state of the science at the time.” While the extensive Systême des connaissances chimiques was written for the advanced scholar, Fourcroy felt the succinct large-format tables would summarize and clearly demonstrate the basic principles and relationships of chemistry for all students. They were originally created as teaching aids to be split up and posted on the wall of a laboratory or classroom, which likely contributed to the current rarity of complete sets. Fourcroy (1755-1809), noted French chemist and professor at the Jardin des Plantes, École Polytechnique, and the École de Médicine, was a dedicated teacher whose celebrated lectures were renowned for their completeness, clarity, and brilliant delivery.

"The travels of Ludovico di Varthema in Egypt, Syria, Arabia, Deserta, Persia, India, and Ethiopia, A.D. 1503-1508. Translated from the Original Italian of 1510...","First edition of this translation of the incredibly popular original Italian edition of 1510 detailing Ludovico di Varthema’s extensive travels to Egypt, Syria, Arabia, Persia, India, and Ethiopia. Varthema is most well known for his escapades, among which he became the first European, non-Muslim to enter Mecca disguised as a pilgrim (a heinous crime at the time), which he details in the work. A raging success, this particular work exposed westerners to Eastern culture, religion, landscape, and customs and was the definitive work on the East for many years. Jones (1805-1881), a British librarian, translator, and editor, manages to capture the humor, simplicity and occasional exaggeration of Varthema. In addition to his work as an editor and translator for the Hakluyt Society, Jones served as the principal librarian of the British Museum from 1866-1873 and was the first president of the United Kingdom’s Library Association in 1877.","Hakluyt Society,","['John Winter JONES', 'Ludovico di VARTHEMA', 'VARTHEMA, Ludovico di; JONES, John Winter (trans)', 'trans']",USD,550.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION OF THIS TRANSLATION.

Ismailia: A Narrative of the Expedition to Central Africa for the Suppression of the Slave Trade,"First American edition after the first printing in London the prior year. Baker’s expedition through Egypt down to Lake Albert in present day Uganda and to the Red Sea was the “first practical step . . . to suppress the slave-trade of Central Africa.” He emphasizes the fertility and potential abundance of the varying lands, whose successes are hindered by corrupt governments. The majority of the team’s interactions with various people and cultures are recounted with a sensational and colonialist flair. Baker (1821-1893) was a British explorer, naturalist, and big game hunter, chiefly remembered for his exploration of central Africa and the “discovery” of the Albert N’yanza (Lake Albert), the source of the Nile River. He won the Royal Geographical Society’s gold medal for this discovery.

Oration of the life and character of Gilbert Motier De Lafayette...In the house of Representatives,"FIRST EDITION, INSCRIBED, of Adams' biography of Gilbert du Motier (1757-1834), until June of 1790 the marquis de La Fayette. Lafayette was a French military officer who participated in both the American and French revolutions. As a result of his services, he was twice granted Honorary Citizenship of the United States, once in 1824 and again, posthumously, in 2002, one of only six persons to be so honored. Books inscribed by Adams (1767-1848) are quite scarce. It is probable that the presentation leaf was placed into the book at the original binding, as it contains heavy offsetting from the title. Potts (ca. 1794-1863) was elected to the State House of Representatives of Pennsylvania before being elected as an Anti-Masonic candidate to the twenty-second through twenty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1831-March 3, 1839).","Gales and Seaton,","['John Quincy ADAMS', 'ADAMS, John Quincy']",USD,6500.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION -- AN INSCRIBED COPY.
The Vocation of Man,"First edition of the English translation by William Smith. Fichte identifies three distinct stages in the development of human existence and the striving for conscious knowledge both theoretical and practical: 1. doubt 2. knowledge 3. faith. Fichte published his famous Wissenschaftslehre, an “essay towards a critique of all revelation” which was an exposition and clarification of Kant’s work, in 1794. He followed up over the next few years covering the theoretical side of his system. Here Fichte reaches for the source of human knowledge, arriving at two conflicting views of human existence: Humans are subject to the cause-and-effect laws of nature, yet their ability to reason will raise humans above the strict necessity that controls the natural world. He concludes that our vocation “is not merely to know but to act in accordance with [our] knowledge.” Fichte (1762-1814) was a German philosopher, one of the founding figures of the philosophical movement known as German idealism, often perceived as a figure whose philosophy forms a bridge between the ideas of Kant and the German idealist Hegel. Chichester Fortescue, Lord Carlingford (1823-1898), was educated at Christ Church, Oxford where he took a first in classics and won the chancellor’s English essay.

After two years at the Rockefeller Center, De Kruif was fired for his anonymous contribution to a book called Civilization, where he described the state of American medicine as a “mélange of religious ritual, more or less accurate folk-lore, and commercial cunning,” also stating that a scientific approach to disease prevention and treatment was undetectable.

Abhandlung uber offentliche Armen- und Kranken-Pflege mit einer umstandlichen Geschichte der ... gemachten Erweiterungs0 und Verbesserungs-Versuchen und der hievon im neuen allgemeinen Kranken-hause....,"First edition of this rare treatise, a cornerstone in the history of hospital reform. The author provides a history of public health and advocates for hospitals to have separate rooms with a ventilation system to remove foul air. Following up on Lavoisier’s research, this work formed the foundation of what became a long discussion over two centuries about the minimum amount of fresh air per occupant needed to maintain comfortable indoor conditions to prevent the spread of germs. An engraved plate of an architectural plan demonstrates the direction of air flow necessary to properly ventilate a hospital. Häberl’s work inspired building designs for hospitals including the construction of the Munich General Hospital in 1813. Häberl (1759-1846) was an acclaimed physician of the National Academy of Sciences in Munich, distinguished for his initiatives to improve the design of hospital facilities by improving air circulation. He invented a vastly improved hydraulic pump, which he implemented in his hospital designs. He was the directing physician for Saint Max, Saint Anna, and Munich General Hospitals before teaching practical pharmacology at the University.

The doings of Raffles Haw.,"First edition, printed in an initial run of 2001 copies. The tale of a modern alchemist who becomes a billionaire and corrupts the community he wants to help. Written while Doyle was on a sojourn in Vienna, in the same year that The adventures of Sherlock Holmes was first published. The creator of the most famous detective in literature, Doyle (1859-1930) produced his first story at the age of six. After completing his medical studies at Edinburgh University, Doyle practiced medicine as an eye specialist in Hampshire for six years until he became a full-time writer. As a medical student, Doyle had several future writers as his colleagues, including James Barrie and Robert Louis Stevenson. However, he was most influenced by his professor, Dr. Joseph Bell, whose skills of observation, logic, deduction and diagnosis were later infused into the persona of Sherlock Holmes.

De plantis libri XVI,"First edition of the first “rational system of plant classification” (PMM). Cesalpino’s work became the foundation of scientific botany and the first articulation of the modern concept of species. With the knowledge of the existence of a greater number of plants, a method of scientific classification was needed. This era began with Cesalpino, who created his system of classification based upon plant morphology. “He insisted that distinctions among species should be made only according to similarity or dissimilarity of forms, and that ‘accidental’ attributes, such as medicinal use and habitat, must not be considered; in doing so, he elevated botany to the level of an independent science” (Norman). The first section of this ground-breaking work contains the general system of comparative study, retaining the traditional divisions of trees, shrubs, half-shrubs and herbs, but further sub-dividing them into different categories according to their seed, fruit and flower. The remaining sections describe over fifteen hundred plants, placing them into fifteen classes. Cesalpino focuses on the roots, stems and fruit as the basis for his classification. It is in this taxonomy that the De plantis most decidedly marks an epoch in the history of botany.

A monograph of the Bucerotidae or family of the hornbills,"First edition. Issued in ten parts, this was the last of Elliott's great ornithological monographs, “a comprehensive treatment of the entire family of hornbills” (Zimmer). “The Bucerotidae are pretty equally divided at the present day between the Ethiopian and Oriental Regions, the first having twenty-seven and the latter twenty-nine species, while but a few, apparently the remaining representatives of a numerous race, are scattered about the islands of the Malay Archipelago” (Introduction). Plate 44, although included on the plate list, was never issued. Elliot (1835-1915), an American zoologist, was one of the founders of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. He produced a number of works on ornithology and comparative zoology, working with illustrators such as Joseph Wolf, Joseph Smit, and of course the celebrated J.G. Keulemans. Following this work Elliot concentrated more on the study of mammals, his time also being split because of his duties as curator of zoology at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, a position he began in 1894.","by the author,","['ELLIOT, Daniel Giraud', 'Daniel Giraud ELLIOT']",USD,17500.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION.
The Nile tributaries of Abyssinia,"First American edition. Baker (1821-1893) was a British explorer, naturalist, and big game hunter, chiefly remembered for his exploration of central Africa and the “discovery” of the Albert N’yanza (Lake Albert), the source of the Nile River. He won the Royal Geographical Society’s gold medal for this discovery. Baker was also a prolific writer and published many popular accounts of his adventures (it is little wonder why his work was so popular - the sensationalist chapter headings would make even Indiana Jones blush!). The present volume details his 12-month exploration of the Nile River system and is an important account of European exploration of Africa during the Victorian period. The double portrait frontispiece of Baker and his wife tells a particularly interesting story - truly the stuff of fiction. Although conflicting reports remain, Baker purportedly bought the future Lady Florence Baker at a white slave auction that he attended with the Maharaja Duleep Singh. Despite the rather strange beginning, Lady Florence Baker was a faithful companion to her husband and joined him on many adventures abroad, including the one described here. This is confirmed by Baker in his preface: “I was accompanied throughout the entire journey by my wife, who,","J. B. Lippincott & Co.,","['BAKER, Sir Samuel W.', 'Sir Samuel W.

Chirurgie der Nieren,"First edition of this historic landmark in urology. In 1869 Simon performed the first successful intentional nephrectomy on a woman patient. That date marks the beginning of renal surgery which he here describes in great detail in Volume I. The second volume, issued five years after the first, treats the subject of kidney surgery on both injured and diseased kidney. He had proved that one healthy kidney can take over the entire excretion process. The illustrations are remarkable. Simon (1824-1876) was a distinguished German surgeon who first served as a military physician. He specialized in the fields of gynecology, orthopedics and military surgery publishing a well known work on gunshot wounds. As professor of surgery at Rostock he published monographs on gynaecological plastic surgery as well as numerous other literary works in many areas of surgery.","Ferdinand Enke,","['SIMON, Gustav', 'Gustav SIMON']",USD,2500.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION.

The principles of science: a treatise on logic and scientific method.,"First edition of the author’s most valuable contribution to logic and methodology. Jevons (1835-1882) was a prominent English logician and political economist. Considered a landmark in the philosophy of science, this work contains practically all of the author’s fundamental ideas on logical doctrine, including his investigation of the principles of pure logic, his analysis of induction, and his discussion of the theory of probability and the relation between probability and induction. The “logical piano” on the engraved frontispiece of the first volume is a fascinating device invented by Jevons that allowed the reduction of logical operations to a simple mechanical routine. Although this machine was first introduced in 1870, some of its features can be traced in modern computer designs.","Macmillan and Co.,","['W. Stanley JEVONS', 'JEVONS, W.

Atlas de toutes les parties connues du globe terrestre. Dresse pour l’historie philosophique et politique des etablissments et de commerce des Europeans dans les deux Indies.,"The maps only (lacking the title page and text) from Bonne’s famous world atlas. Bonne is responsible for the most detailed and accurate maps of the period. They include the newly formed United States of America, as well as specific areas such as Texas, Louisiana, Baja California, and parts of Florida and Northern Mexico, as well as Canada and Cuba. Bonne’s work marks an important step in the evolution of cartography from a decorative work towards a more detail oriented and practical aesthetic. Bonne (1727-1794) was one of the most prominent cartographers of the late eighteenth century. He was appointed as Royal Cartographer to France in the office of the Hydrographer at the Depot de la Marine (Department of the Navy). Bound in before the atlas is the title page, text and one folding map from the 1808 edition of Recueil de cartes géographiques, plans, vues et médailles de l’ancienne Grèce by Barbié du Bocage, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy and Jean Denis Barbié du Bocage.","Pellet,","['BONNE, Rigobert', 'Rigobert BONNE']",USD,850.0,InStock,
Life of James Abram Garfield.,"Originally published in 1880 under the title, The life of James A.

Garfield to the day of the nomination was prepared by Major J.M. Bundy, editor of the New York Evening Mail, at Mentor, under the roof of the President, a large portion of it being taken down verbatim from Mr. Garfield’s lips. The whole of it was submitted to him for approval before publication. . .

"The register of arts, or a compendious view of some of the most useful modern discoveries and inventions","First edition of this useful compendium of short articles on various technologies, methods, and experiments related mostly to agriculture and technology. Topics include purifying infected air, cultivating potatoes, steam engines, and, of particular importance, humane chimney sweeping. It is an interesting work not only for the overview of technologies in use during the heyday of the Industrial Revolution, but also in the history of patents and intellectual property, as the editor “was induced to divulge no more of the process than what might be deemed absolutely necessary.” Interestingly, the last entry in the publisher’s advertisements announces the forthcoming publication of the official account of the Lewis and Clark expedition that took place in 1804-1806. The publication history of this work is notoriously fraught with competition and delays; the first official account, which was originally contracted to Conrad and advertised here, was not in fact finished until 1814 and published by another firm. Fessenden (1771-1837) was an American author and editor who was primarily interested in agriculture and industry, though he seems to have been more talented at writing about these subjects than making sound investments in them.","C. and A.

Ars Conjectandi,"First edition of a milestone in the history of mathematics. Although left unfinished, it affords abundant evidence of the ability of one of history’s greatest mathematicians. Especially notable is the theorem which “places the theory of probability in a more commanding position than it had hitherto occupied” (Todhunter). Bernouilli here uses the terms a priori and a posteriori to distinguish two ways of deriving probabilities: deduction without experience (a priori) is possible with some devices such as dice but otherwise it is possible to make a deduction from various observed results of similar events. At the end we find the epistle Lettre a’ un ami, dur le parties du Jeau de Paume where the probability calculation is applied to one of the most significant cultural and social phenomenon in Renaissance, the sports game of jeu de paume. “It is still the foundation of much modern practice in all fields where probability is concerned -- insurance, statistics and mathematical heredity tables” (PMM). Jakob Bernoulli (1654-1705) was the eldest in a family of celebrated mathematicians. He occupied the chair in mathematics at the University of Basel until his death.","Thurnheysen,",BERNOULLI Jacob,USD,30000.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION.

Visions: A study of false sight. (Pseudopia). With an introduction and memorial sketch by Oliver Wendell Holmes.,"First edition of Clarke’s (1820-77) final work, a study of hallucinations and visions, and their causes. It contains an interesting study of the effects of drugs such as quinine, digitalis, opium, Indian Hemp (hashish), ether and alcohol on vision, as well as the influence of disease and volition. Clarke details a case communicated to him by the neurologist and novelist S. Weir Mitchell, one of the most prominent physicians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Oliver Wendell Holmes edited the work after Clarke’s death, writing a memorial sketch and biographical introduction. A friend and classmate of Holmes at Harvard, Clarke succeeded Jacob Bigelow as Professor of Materia Medica there, a post he held for twenty years. He wrote this book in his last days, Holmes rendering frequent visits to assist the dying author. Clarke's other works include, Practical Medicine, The building of the brain, and various articles for the New American Cyclopaedia.

"The historie of tithes: that is, the practice of payment of them, the positiue laws made for them, the opinions touching the right of them: a review of it is also annext, which both confirmes it and directs in the use of it","First edition, most likely the fourth variant listed by STC, of this early work of anti-establishmentarianism. \""This book shows that the practices of the early church are inconsistent with the view that tithes are payable by divine right\"" (Marke). While the work was only published after being submitted to the censor, and never expressly denied the doctrine of divine right, it still caused great concern amongst the bishops. This led to the intervention of James I, who called Selden before the privy council to compel a retraction, and to furthermore forbid him to answer or defend his work in any way after its suppression. Selden (1584-1654) was an English jurist and legal antiquary. His earliest patron was the antiquary Sir Robert Bruce Cotton (1570-1631) to whom this work is dedicated. Perhaps due to the controversy of the present work, Selden became very involved in politics, opposing political absolutism. He took part in and instigated the protest on the rights and privileges of the House in 1621, for which he and several others were briefly imprisoned. He was later elected numerous times to Parliament, and played a major role in the impeachment of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.","[s.n],","['John SELDEN', 'SELDEN, John']",USD,1200.0,InStock,"FIRST EDITION, FOURTH VARIANT."

Captain Robert Fitzroy (1805-1865) commanded the five-year expedition, during which time the Beagle visited Brazil, Argentina, Tierra del Fuego, Chili, Peru, the Galapagos Islands, New Zealand, Australia, and other countries and islands on the way.

An investigation of the laws of thought,"First edition, possibly the second issue of this classic work on symbolic logic, now quite scarce, or otherwise possibly a variant issue altogether (see below). Boole (1815-1864) demonstrated how the laws of formal logic could be incorporated into a calculus. This combination of the two fields revolutionized mathematics, philosophy, and linguistics, and paved the way for the design of high-speed computers. Boole demonstrates that logical propositions can be expressed as mathematical equations, and that the algebraic manipulation of symbols in those equations offers a fail-safe method of logical deduction. The Laws of thought extends his exploration of logic, and introduces another ground-breaking concept, mathematical probability. Bertrand Russell remarked that “pure mathematics was discovered by George Boole” (Bell, Men of Mathematics, p. 441). The issue points are in question here as the book has been rebound. The first issue apparently finds the errata leaf at the end, but it is possible it could have been moved when the book was rebound.","Walton and Maberly,","['BOOLE, George', 'George BOOLE']",USD,8000.0,InStock,FIRST EDITION.
