Tax Policy Challenges in the 21st Century,"The Major Developments in Tax Policy Steadily increasing globalization as well as the financial and economic crisis have brought major challenges for states in ensuring budgetary consolidation while maintaining sustainable economic growth. These developments have not only influenced political and economic discussions in the 21st century, but also raise new questions on the role of taxation in the economic policy environment. National taxation systems worldwide are subject to significant changes and it is assumed that they will develop in a more co-operative way in the near future. This book aims at identifying the major developments in tax policy in the 21st century on a national as well as on an international level and gives an in-depth analysis of the challenges and risks, but also of the opportunities connected to these developments.

Hybrid Entities in Tax Treaty Law,"Tax treaty law and EU tax law in connection with hybrid entities Hybrid entities have traditionally been used as an avenue for international tax planning, and extending benefits under tax treaties to such entities has been a source of controversy for many years now. Although the OECD Partnership Report provided solid policy footing on this issue, there was still no common legal basis that countries could rely on for such positions. The increasing focus of countries towards the curbing of tax avoidance and abuse involving hybrid mismatch arrangements culminated in a specific action plan in the BEPS Project being dedicated to the design of domestic rules and the development of treaty provisions that would neutralize the tax effects of such arrangements. This volume provides an in-depth analysis of various aspects of this topic. It is divided into two parts – the first dealing exclusively with tax treaty issues arising in connection with hybrid entities and the second dealing with EU tax law issues surrounding hybrid entities.

Transfer Pricing and Value Creation,"Value Creation and its effects on Transfer Pricing and tax law Emerging from the OECD/G20 BEPS Project, a new, somewhat fuzzy notion of Value Creation came to permeate not only Transfer Pricing language but also wider allocation rules and anti-abuse provisions in international tax law. The notion of ‘Value Creation’ reframes the interpretation and application of the Arm’s Length Principle (ALP) that is embedded in Articles 7 and 9 of the OECD Model Convention. This new Value Creation notion and approach assist in understanding key enterprise functions while different industry sectors manifest these concepts in various ways. Situating such notions and this approach within the law of tax treaties and analyzing terms of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines alongside their factual context is the aim of this book. Here, law students address Transfer Pricing and Value Creation in sectors as varied as commodities trade, automotive, consumer products, food and beverages, pharmaceutical and life sciences, telecommunications, and the key topic of value creation in a digitalized economy. Our LL.M. students were required to address issues not explored in legal research and to discuss factual topics relevant for Transfer Pricing.

Transfer Pricing and Intangibles,"Transfer pricing treatment of intangibles: Issues und developments In recent decades, intangibles have become one of the most relevant success factors for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). Along with the increasing importance of intangibles for economies, their tax treatment has also been under scrutiny which includes inter alia respective transfer pricing issues. MNEs are seeking for the best ways to optimize their business arrangements with the related intangibles while, at the same time, getting the most tax-efficient treatment. On the other hand, tax authorities have become increasingly concerned with the ease that intangibles can be used in aggressive planning. These concerns have been noticed and addressed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which presented its main findings with respect to transfer pricing aspects of intangibles in Action 8 of the BEPS Project in 2015 and in the 2017 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. This book is based on the outcomes of the presentations and discussions held during the WU Transfer Pricing Symposium, ‘Transfer Pricing and Intangibles: Current Developments, Relevant Issues and Possible Solutions’, that took place in October 2018 at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business.

OECD Arbitration in Tax Treaty Law,"Arbitration: the solution to tackle cross-border tax disputes From the increasing integration of the world economy and the lack of rules to govern the taxation of multinational enterprises to cross-border tax disputes: arbitration is one potential solution. Arbitration is not a new development in the international tax arena, but it has not yet been widely implemented in practice. In the last few years, the concept of arbitration in tax matters was revived, mainly following the OECD/G20 BEPS Project, as well as the EU Action Plan on Corporate Taxation. Now arbitration is expected to play a more significant role and enhance the existing framework of cross-border tax dispute resolution. „OECD Arbitration in Tax Treaty Law” constitutes a comprehensive compendium on international tax arbitration and provides in-depth analysis of all relevant aspects of the topic. The introductory chapters provide background information on tax arbitration and comparisons with other areas of law.

Transfer Pricing and Intangibles,"Transfer pricing treatment of intangibles: Issues und developments In recent decades, intangibles have become one of the most relevant success factors for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). Along with the increasing importance of intangibles for economies, their tax treatment has also been under scrutiny which includes inter alia respective transfer pricing issues. MNEs are seeking for the best ways to optimize their business arrangements with the related intangibles while, at the same time, getting the most tax-efficient treatment. On the other hand, tax authorities have become increasingly concerned with the ease that intangibles can be used in aggressive planning. These concerns have been noticed and addressed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which presented its main findings with respect to transfer pricing aspects of intangibles in Action 8 of the BEPS Project in 2015 and in the 2017 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. This book is based on the outcomes of the presentations and discussions held during the WU Transfer Pricing Symposium, ‘Transfer Pricing and Intangibles: Current Developments, Relevant Issues and Possible Solutions’, that took place in October 2018 at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business.

CJEU - Recent Developments in Direct Taxation 2018,"CJEU - The most important cases in the field of direct taxation A great number of cases pending before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concern the fundamental freedoms and direct taxation. In particular, the number of infringement procedures brought before the CJEU by the European Commission has been increasing year on year. The CJEU is still in the driver’s seat in the area of direct taxation. All judgements and pending cases, therefore, have to be carefully analyzed by academics as well as practitioners. This book discusses the most important cases in the field of direct taxation pending before or recently decided by the CJEU. Moreover, the national background of these cases is discussed and possible infringements of the fundamental freedoms and secondary EU law are analyzed. The analyses are presented by esteemed national and European tax law experts. By examining the preliminary questions, the arguments brought forward by the parties and existing CJEU case law, the authors provide insight into the possible reasoning of the Court.

Special Features of the UN Model Convention,"Detailed research on the UN Model Convention’s unique features The UN Model Convention has a significant influence on international tax treaty practice and is especially used by emerging and developing countries as a starting point for treaty negotiations. Driven by the aim to achieve consistency in the international tax treaty practice, the structure and content is, to a large extent, similar in the UN Model and the OECD Model. However, whereas the OECD has historically focused its efforts on issues mainly relevant for developed countries, the UN Tax Committee has continuously attempted to specifically take into account tax treaty policies for developing countries when drafting and amending the UN Model Convention. Compared to the OECD Model Convention, the UN Model Convention aims at giving more weight to the source principle. Popular examples are the PE definition in the UN Model which provides for a lower threshold than Article 5 of the OECD Model or Article 12A on Fees for Technical Services which has been introduced with the latest amendment of the UN Model Convention 2017 and allows for a withholding tax to be levied on payments to non-residents when the payer of the fee is a resident of that contracting",,30.09.2019,,https://www.lindeverlag.at/onlineprodukt/special-features-of-the-un-model-convention-3127,1.

Non-Discrimination in European and Tax Treaty Law,"Selected issues of the various non-discrimination concepts Non-discrimination plays an important, if not crucial, role in many areas of law, such as constitutional law, human rights law, world trade law, EU law and tax treaty law. Both direct and indirect taxation are affected by the various types of non-discrimination provisions. From a practical point of view, the non-discrimination provisions within the EU legal framework and the non-discrimination concept under Article 24 of the OECD Model are important examples in this respect. In both areas of non-discrimination law, there are many open issues which have been debated for a long time and have evolved as evergreens of non-discrimination in the area of taxation; examples are the meaning of the ECJ’s case law on the “finality” of losses or the compatibility of group regimes with Article 24 of the OECD Model. Other problems have emerged only recently, because of current developments at the OECD level, notably the BEPS project. Therefore, non-discrimination suggested itself as a general topic for the master theses of the full-time LL.M. program in 2014/2015. This book takes up and deals with selected issues in depth. Although the relevant non-discrimination provisions are different in wording and context, often the",,16.09.2015,,https://www.lindeverlag.at/onlineprodukt/non-discrimination-in-european-and-tax-treaty-law-1475,1.

Global Trends in VAT/GST and Direct Taxes,"Recent developments in direct taxes and VAT/GST Taxes – in general – have become the topic of broad legal and policy discussions. VAT and GST are often said to be the fiscal success story of the 20th century, as almost all developed countries levy VAT or GST or similar all-encompassing broad-based consumption taxes. Global trends in direct taxes are visible at the level of international players, such as the OECD. Due to the OECD’s BEPS project, national tax systems are being significantly modified. This book aims at identifying and discussing the current global trends in both VAT/GST and direct taxes. In daily practice, VAT/GST and direct taxes should be regarded simultaneously. Therefore, the Master’s theses contained in this book deal with and highlight numerous issues, challenges and opportunities found in both direct taxes and in the VAT/GST area, ranging from nexus in direct taxes and VAT/GST, recent developments in certain policy areas, the definition of taxable persons, tax abuse, non-discrimination rules, charities, transfer pricing, European State aid, immovable property, share deals etc. While the construction of VAT/GST and direct taxes differs, both taxes have similarities.

Limiting Base Erosion,"Limiting base erosion from different viewpoints Hybrid mismatch arrangements, CFC rules, transfer pricing rules: “Limiting Base Erosion”, the general topic for the master theses of the part-time LL.M. program 2015-2017, has been one of the most controversial topics in international tax law ever since the initiation of the OECD BEPS Project in 2013. Even though the final reports of the 15 BEPS Actions were released by the OECD in as early as October 2015, the question how to effectively target base erosion practices still has not lost any of its topicality. Following the efforts of the OECD in developing a new international tax environment, the focus of attention has now partly shifted to the OECD Member countries that have to properly implement the OECD recommendations in their domestic laws as well as in their tax treaty practice. In this respect, a comprehensive analysis in the literature of all the issues related to base erosion proves to be of the utmost importance in order to provide practical guidance to the Member countries during that the process of implementation.

While awaiting possible fundamental reforms of the tax framework, it is time to discuss anti-BEPS measures bearing in mind the peculiar features of the digital economy such as increased mobility, no need for physical presence, and dematerialization.

Global Trends in VAT/GST and Direct Taxes,"Recent developments in direct taxes and VAT/GST Taxes – in general – have become the topic of broad legal and policy discussions. VAT and GST are often said to be the fiscal success story of the 20th century, as almost all developed countries levy VAT or GST or similar all-encompassing broad-based consumption taxes. Global trends in direct taxes are visible at the level of international players, such as the OECD. Due to the OECD’s BEPS project, national tax systems are being significantly modified. This book aims at identifying and discussing the current global trends in both VAT/GST and direct taxes. In daily practice, VAT/GST and direct taxes should be regarded simultaneously. Therefore, the Master’s theses contained in this book deal with and highlight numerous issues, challenges and opportunities found in both direct taxes and in the VAT/GST area, ranging from nexus in direct taxes and VAT/GST, recent developments in certain policy areas, the definition of taxable persons, tax abuse, non-discrimination rules, charities, transfer pricing, European State aid, immovable property, share deals etc. While the construction of VAT/GST and direct taxes differs, both taxes have similarities.

CJEU - Recent Developments in Direct Taxation 2018,"CJEU - The most important cases in the field of direct taxation A great number of cases pending before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) concern the fundamental freedoms and direct taxation. In particular, the number of infringement procedures brought before the CJEU by the European Commission has been increasing year on year. The CJEU is still in the driver’s seat in the area of direct taxation. All judgements and pending cases, therefore, have to be carefully analyzed by academics as well as practitioners. This book discusses the most important cases in the field of direct taxation pending before or recently decided by the CJEU. Moreover, the national background of these cases is discussed and possible infringements of the fundamental freedoms and secondary EU law are analyzed. The analyses are presented by esteemed national and European tax law experts. By examining the preliminary questions, the arguments brought forward by the parties and existing CJEU case law, the authors provide insight into the possible reasoning of the Court. Moreover, this book goes to the heart of the national tax systems, exposing hidden obstacles to the fundamental freedoms.","E-Book | Format: E-Pub, PDF",03.07.2019,9783709410349.0,https://www.lindeverlag.at/ebook/cjeu-recent-developments-in-direct-taxation-2018-18384,1.

Hybrid Entities in Tax Treaty Law,"Tax treaty law and EU tax law in connection with hybrid entities Hybrid entities have traditionally been used as an avenue for international tax planning, and extending benefits under tax treaties to such entities has been a source of controversy for many years now. Although the OECD Partnership Report provided solid policy footing on this issue, there was still no common legal basis that countries could rely on for such positions. The increasing focus of countries towards the curbing of tax avoidance and abuse involving hybrid mismatch arrangements culminated in a specific action plan in the BEPS Project being dedicated to the design of domestic rules and the development of treaty provisions that would neutralize the tax effects of such arrangements. This volume provides an in-depth analysis of various aspects of this topic. It is divided into two parts – the first dealing exclusively with tax treaty issues arising in connection with hybrid entities and the second dealing with EU tax law issues surrounding hybrid entities. The former part comprises chapters analysing how tax treaties have historically dealt with this issue with a focus on domestic court jurisprudence, the positions in the OECD and the UN Model Conventions, the developments",,01.09.2020,,https://www.lindeverlag.at/onlineprodukt/hybrid-entities-in-tax-treaty-law-3393,1.

Transfer Pricing and Intangibles,"Transfer pricing treatment of intangibles: Issues und developments In recent decades, intangibles have become one of the most relevant success factors for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). Along with the increasing importance of intangibles for economies, their tax treatment has also been under scrutiny which includes inter alia respective transfer pricing issues. MNEs are seeking for the best ways to optimize their business arrangements with the related intangibles while, at the same time, getting the most tax-efficient treatment. On the other hand, tax authorities have become increasingly concerned with the ease that intangibles can be used in aggressive planning. These concerns have been noticed and addressed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which presented its main findings with respect to transfer pricing aspects of intangibles in Action 8 of the BEPS Project in 2015 and in the 2017 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. This book is based on the outcomes of the presentations and discussions held during the WU Transfer Pricing Symposium, ‘Transfer Pricing and Intangibles: Current Developments, Relevant Issues and Possible Solutions’, that took place in October 2018 at the WU Vienna University of Economics and Business.

Transfer Pricing and Value Creation,"Value Creation and its effects on Transfer Pricing and tax law Emerging from the OECD/G20 BEPS Project, a new, somewhat fuzzy notion of Value Creation came to permeate not only Transfer Pricing language but also wider allocation rules and anti-abuse provisions in international tax law. The notion of ‘Value Creation’ reframes the interpretation and application of the Arm’s Length Principle (ALP) that is embedded in Articles 7 and 9 of the OECD Model Convention. This new Value Creation notion and approach assist in understanding key enterprise functions while different industry sectors manifest these concepts in various ways. Situating such notions and this approach within the law of tax treaties and analyzing terms of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines alongside their factual context is the aim of this book. Here, law students address Transfer Pricing and Value Creation in sectors as varied as commodities trade, automotive, consumer products, food and beverages, pharmaceutical and life sciences, telecommunications, and the key topic of value creation in a digitalized economy. Our LL.M. students were required to address issues not explored in legal research and to discuss factual topics relevant for Transfer Pricing.
