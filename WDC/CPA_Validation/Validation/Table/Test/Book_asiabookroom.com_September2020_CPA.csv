Journeys on the Silk Road.,"Map, black and white photographic illustrations, ix + 323 pages, index, paperback. Minor wear, upper corner bumped, otherwise in good condition. The remarkable story of the world's oldest printed book begins in a meditation cave on the edge of the Gobi Desert. In 1900, a monk who guarded the sacred Caves of the Thousand Buddhas in western China discovered a hidden library that had been sealed for more than a thousand years. When explorer Aurel Stein arrived during a dangerous and secret journey in 1907, he persuaded the monk to part with some of the treasures, including a copy of the 'Diamond Sutra' - dated AD868. Printed 500 years before Gutenberg's famous Bible, the discovery has illuminated the spread of Buddhism along the Silk Road and coincided with the growing appeal of this ancient tradition in the West. The 'Diamond Sutra', a key teaching of the Buddha, has influenced Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation and continues to inspire the Dalai Lama. Journeys on the Silk Road is an explorer's tale, a literary investigation, an evocation of the travelling power of the book and of the impact of a spiritual tradition that has resonated with the modern world.

Bells of Old Tokyo. Travels in Japanese Time.,"336pp, notes, bibliography, paperback. In The Bells of Old Tokyo, Anna Sherman explores Japan and revels in all its wonderful particularity. As a foreigner living in Tokyo, Sherman's account takes pleasure and fascination in the history and culture of a country that can seem startlingly strange to an outsider. Following her search for the lost bells of the city - the bells by which its inhabitants kept time before the Jesuits introduced them to clocks - to her personal friendship with the owner of a small, exquisite cafe, who elevates the making and drinking of coffee to an art-form, here is Tokyo in its bewildering variety. From the love hotels of Shinjuku to the appalling fire-storms of 1945 (in which many more thousands of people died than in Hiroshima or Nagasaki), from the death of Mishima to the impact of the Tohoku earthquake of 2011. For fans of The Lonely City, and Lost in Translation, The Bells of Old Tokyo is a beautiful and original portrait of Tokyo told through time.

"Organising Under the Revolution. Unions and the State in Java, 1945-48.","Black and white photographic illustrations, xiii + 215 pages, index, bibliography, appendices, paperback. The years 1945-48 marked the peak of the Indonesian revolution, but they were also formative years for state-labour relationship in modern Indonesia. Drawing on a wide range of historical sources, Jafar Suryomenggolo reconstructs labour's initial drive to form and orient unions during this critical period. The historical narrative captures early unions' nationalist spirit and efforts to defend members' socio-economic interests, and shows the steps taken by the labour movement to maintain its independence and build institutional capacity within the new Indonesian state. Organising under the Revolution challenges the prevailing assumptions that see labour movements as political arms of the post-colonial state. The author's conclusions provide a comparative lens for the study of labour movements in Southeast Asia, and developing countries in general.

Buddhism in Contemporary Tibet. Religious Revival and Cultural Identity.,"Black and white photographic illustrations, vii+ ix + 203pp, index, paperback in very good condition. Appendix: Spellings of Tibetan names and terms. Demonstrating how the Buddhist revival in Tibet must contend with tensions between the Chinese state and aspirations for greater Tibetan autonomy, the authors discuss ways that Tibetan Buddhists are restructuring their religion through a process of social, political and economic adaptation., Following the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution, the People's Republic of China gradually permitted the renewal of religious activity. Tibetans, whose traditional religious and cultural institutions had been decimated during the preceding two decades, took advantage of the decisions of 1978 to begin a Buddhist renewal that is one of the most extensive and dramatic examples of religious revitalization in contemporary China. The nature of that revival is the focus of this book., Four specialists in Tibetan anthropology and religion conducted case studies in the Tibet autonomous region and among the Tibetans of Sichuan and Qinghai provinces. There they observed the revival of the Buddhist heritage in monastic communities and among laypersons at popular pilgrimages and festivals. Demonstrating how that revival must contend with tensions between the Chinese state and aspirations for greater Tibetan autonomy, the authors","['MATTHEW T.', 'MELVYN C.

生命保険漫画. [Seimei Hoken Manga]. [Life Insurance Manga Postcards].,"5 colour manga postcards, 9 x 15 cm, in slightly foxed original envelope. Postcards are all in very good condition. This set of manga postcards were published in1933 by Nippon Life Insurance Company to promote the benefits of life insurance. Nippon Life Insurance Company was established in Osaka in 1889. Instead of presenting figures and tables, each manga tries to illustrate the sense of reassurance people would experience when they buy this company's insurance. For example, a manga by Okamoto Ippei, a famous manga illustrator in the pre-war Japan, depicts a \""Family Boat\"" where young and old members each wear a lifebelt represent their insurance policy while sailing. Its caption says that a insurance policy is a rescue buoy for life, which would make people feel peaceful even on the roughest of seas. Another card features a young attractive geisha sitting coquettishly at home is an advertisement for an old age insurance policy. The text assures the viewer that their policy will be paid back in full when the policy matures. The couple plan to use the money to fund the granddaughter's honeymoon trip and their own holiday, anticipating that they would live long enough to receive the matured fund.","['OKAMOTO IPPEI', '岡本一平他', '[OKAMOTO IPPEI AND OTHERS]. 岡本一平他.']",200.0,AUD,InStock

Talking North. The Journey of Australia's First Asian Language.,"Black and white illustrations, xix + 284pp, paperback. What makes one nation curious about another nation? Curious enough that the study of the other's culture and language becomes a natural commitment or something that could be described as a national project? This question lies behind much of the writing in this book as it explores the history, education policy and changing fortunes of the Indonesian/Malay language in Australia. While formal education programs are central to this discussion, individual effort and chance encounters with the language are also examined in the context of Australia's evolving historical ties with its near neighbours. These relationships have grown in importance since the end of the Second World War, but Australians typically continue to view the region as 'testing'. This is exemplified by the Australian-Indonesian relationship, the primary focus of this volume. While much has been written on the political relationship, this book builds its view of the two countries' interactions on the cultural activity of language learning. This is, perhaps, the most fundamental of cultural activities in any effort to promote mutual understanding. (When referring to this item please quote stockid 164358).","['PAUL S.

"Through a Forest of Chancellors. Fugutive Histories in Liu Yuan's Lingyan ge, an Illustrated Book from Seventeenth Century Suzhou. F","Black and white illustrations, 378pp, notes, words cited, character list, index, very good copy in dustjacket. Liu Yuan's \""Lingyan ge\"", a woodblock-printed book from 1669, re-creates a portrait gallery that memorialized 24 vassals of the early Tang court. Liu accompanied each figure, presented under the guise of a bandit, with a couplet; the poems, written in various scripts, are surrounded by marginal images that allude to a contemporary novel. Religious icons supplement the portrait gallery. Liu's re-creation is fraught with questions. This study examines the dialogues created among the texts and images in \""Lingyan ge\"" from multiple perspectives. Analysis of the book's materialities demonstrates how \""Lingyan ge\"" embodies, rather than reflects, the historical moment in which it was made. Liu unveiled and even dramatized the interface between manuscript and printed book in \""Lingyan ge\"". Authority over the book's production is negotiated, asserted, overturned, and reinstated. Use of pictures to construct a historical argument intensifies this struggle. Anne Burkus-Chasson argues that despite a general epistemological shift toward visual forms of knowledge in the seventeenth century, looking and reading were still seen as being in conflict. This conflict plays out among the leaves of Liu Yuan's book. (When referring to this item","['BURKUS-CHASSON, ANNE.', 'ANNE BURKUS-CHASSON']",95.0,AUD,InStock

銅鐫 地球萬國方圖. [Dōsen chikyū bankoku hōzu]. [Map of the World].,"Large handcoloured Japanese copper engraved folding map of the world, 124 x 100cm. Little browned along folds, tiny hole at one fold, some worming in upper margin repaired with Japanese paper. A good copy. Apparently based on an earlier Dutch map this handsome map is full of geographical and historical detail. Although clearly drawing information from Dutch sources, the map is still distinctively Japanese as the inclusion of the large landmass along the southern section of the world clearly demonstrates. There are very many interesting details on this map. It shows the Sea of Japan as both Great Japan Sea (in large characters) and Sea of Korea in smaller font. The map of Australia shows the date of \""discovery\"" for various areas, gold mines are indicated in New South Wales. Information about Australia provided on the map includes - \""In 1606 the Dutchman Willem Jansen (sic) in a ship called the Diofento (sic) was the first person to reach this land\""; printed characters in the eastern part of South Australia translate as \""discovered by Captain Flinders\""; on the northern part of Western Australia it states - \""Dampier in 1699 and Cook's voyage in 1770 were the first to see this","['橋爪貫一.

The City of Heavenly Tranquillity. Beijing in the History of China.,"Maps, black and white photographic plates, viii + 370pp, bibliography, notes, index, dustjacket little creased at foot of spine, very good hardback copy. The great city of Beijing, capital of China from the ninth century, and given its form for five hundred years by the Ming Dynasty, was for a millennium one of the most extraordinary places on earth. At a time when London, Paris, or Rome had only several hundred thousand residents, Beijing held over a million. This book tells the history of this great city, and through it's history provides a highly engaging summary history of China. In the summer of 1997, President Jiang Zemin made a decision to destroy the old city. There was no announcement, no explanation given, nor any attempt made to justify his decision. Even those working as architects only became aware of what was happening when it was already too late. Expertly moving between historical analysis and reportage, Jasper Becker describes the impact of this systematic destruction. This is a unique telling of the history of Beijing that encapsulates both the grandeur of its creation and the tragedy of its current transformation.
