Crossway Classic Commentaries: 1 & 2 Thessalonians,"Forced out of Thessalonica by the Jews for his effective ministry, Paul wrote to encourage and teach new believers there.

It is a faith that is full of vigor, employing itself in the labors of love, intent upon the hope of the manifestation of Christ, despising everything else, and armed with an endurance that rises above the weariness of time and worldly temptations. Paul’s second epistle then expands upon and clarifies some of his teachings from the first letter. John Calvin delves into the rich meaning of Paul’s encouraging words. He brings insight into the historical church, as well as instructing today’s pastors on maintaining a healthy church and inspiring believers to grow in their daily walk.",http://schema.org/EBook,1999-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,John Calvin,Crossway,USD,9781856841931,,,10.99

In His Service: The Christian Calling to Charity,"In this text Rushdoony argues that a modern, self-centered church has isolated the faith to a pietism that relinquishes charitable responsibility to the state—resulting in empowering a humanistic world order. He discusses the difficulty the church has in recovering the biblical meaning of words like charity and compassion. He argues that because post–World War II liberalism has redefined them politically into state welfarism and that this redefinition has made charity a political tool to retain social order—and made the state the primary agency of compassion. But biblical compassion flows from our having first received the grace of God and then manifesting it to others. Therefore, biblical charity—which is compassion in action—is personal. It begins with God’s mercy towards us, and then the people of God give expression to that at an individual level. It is in his service that we understand our calling to charity.

A Mouth Full of Fire: The Word of God in the Words of Jeremiah (New Studies in Biblical Theology),"“I am putting my words as a fire in your mouth; these people are tinder and it will consume them” (Jeremiah 5:14). In the book of Jeremiah, not only is the vocabulary of “word” and “words” uniquely prevalent, but formulae marking divine speech also play an unprecedented role in giving the book’s final form its narrative and theological shape. Indeed, “the word of the Lord” is arguably the main character and a theology that is both distinctive and powerful, which can be seen to emerge from the unfolding narrative. Andrew Shead examines Jeremiah’s use of “word” language. He sees the prophet’s formation as an embodiment of the word of God. A Mouth Full of Fire examines Jeremiah’s covenant preaching and the crisis it precipitates concerning the recognition of true prophecy. Shead shows, in the “oracles of hope,” how the power of the word of God is finally made manifest.

Once its purpose is grasped, the book comes alive. It can be seen as nothing less than a final and momentous look back over the entire Old Testament.

The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles bring a divine word of healing and reaffirm the hope of restoration. The Chronicler's theme is straightforward - the promises of God revealed in the Davidic covenant are as trustworthy and as effective as the God who first uttered them.,http://schema.org/EBook,1994-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Martin Selman,IVP,USD,,,,15.99
Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography and Textual Criticism,"Paleography is the dating and study of ancient writings and inscription. Textual criticism is the study of manuscripts to determine the trustworthiness of the text with respect to establishing authenticity.

In Encountering the Manuscripts Comfort explores scribal participation in the production of the earliest New Testament writings, gives an annotated list of all significant Greek manuscripts and early versions, assigns dates for the earliest manuscripts, presents the history of textual variation in the early centuries of the church, details various methods of recovering the original wording of the Greek New Testament, and provides concrete examples for the practice of textual criticism.",http://schema.org/EBook,2005-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Philip W.

Character Forged from Conflict: Staying Connected to God During Controversy,"In this changing culture, pastors need dedication to do what God wants them to do. They need hope that the suffering they experience while serving Christ has purpose and meaning. Some of the first words uttered by a new pastor are “Seminary never prepared me for this.” Often “this” refers to church conflict. Most pastors, rookies and veterans alike, experience the betrayal, the hurt, and the anger that comes with working in a church. The pain of conflict cuts to the soul, and only words that address the soul can begin the healing process. Longtime pastor Gary Preston has been wounded, but instead of techniques to handle conflict better, he explores how the conflict he has faced as a pastor has driven him to God. Preston speaks not with cynicism but with candor about the realities of local church work. He points pastors back to God and offers hope for finding grace and comfort in the midst of suffering.",http://schema.org/EBook,1999-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Gary D. Preston,Bethany House,USD,,,,16.99
"Job, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs (Cornerstone Biblical Commentary, vol. 6 | CBC)","The books of Job, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs belong to the category of writings typically termed “wisdom literature.” Biblical wisdom may be defined as the exposition of a fundamental order within the universe, and wisdom is to know and follow this order. The reality of life is that the affirmations of traditional wisdom often contradict the experience of the faithful. Bad things happen to good people; and, conversely, good things often happen to bad people. August H. Konkel confronts the tension in the book of Job between the idea that virtue has its own reward and the reality that the virtuous often suffer.

The Israelite sages sought in their optimistic teachings to express “the mystery that surrounds all human action: not only self-knowledge, but knowledge of the mysterious role of God.” Much of the wisdom of Proverbs points out the ambiguities of life.

We meet Ruth, a young foreign woman from Moab who attached herself to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and to Naomi’s God. And we meet Boaz, who, by marrying Ruth, fitted into God’s purposes for history. Both King David and Jesus are numbered among their descendants. Goethe calls it “the loveliest complete work on a small scale, handed down to us as an ethical treatise and an idyll.” Another writes, “No poet in the world has written a more beautiful short story.” David Atkinson demonstrates clearly that the story of Ruth, theologically, is a story about God’s providence.",http://schema.org/EBook,1985-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,David J.

Moving from sensitive descriptions of “the surprising work of God” in conversion to a consuming quest for the essence of true religion, and threading his way through mounting controversies over “errors in doctrine and disorders in practice,” Edwards sought to locate an authentic core of evangelical experience, to define it in terms of biblical faith and psychological insight, and to defend it against both overheated zealous and rationalistic critics. The tracts that unfold his thoughts, presented here (with related correspondence) for the first time in accurate critical texts, document a movement so significant for the American character that it has been called “our national conversion.” In a carefully researched introduction, C.

God Strengthens: Ezekiel Simply Explained (Welwyn Commentary Series | WCS),"Ezekiel's name means \""God strengthens.\"" Every time the prophet's name was mentioned, God's people were assured of his help and reminded of his promise to \""strengthen the weak.\"" Ezekiel lived in times of great political turmoil and witnessed the final collapse of Judah to the Babylonian empire. His total, unquestioning willingness to do God's will, often at great cost to himself, during the long years of his faithful ministry in exile, is a shining example to Christian workers everywhere. The message of Ezekiel is one of God's faithfulness to his covenant, both in carrying out judgment on sin and in the restoration and blessing of a remnant through the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. The prophet's final vision looks forward to days of great blessing, encompassing not only the restoration from exile, but the blessings of the new covenant and the final glory of heaven.",http://schema.org/EBook,1993-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Derek W.

"The Works of Jonathan Edwards, vol. 20: The \""Miscellanies\"", 833–1152","Throughout his adult life Jonathan Edwards kept a series of personal theological notebooks on a wide variety of miscellaneous subjects. This volume includes the notebook entries written during the eventful and tumultuous years 1740–1751, when Edwards was plagued by a series of bitter controversies with his Northampton congregation that culminated in his dismissal. This was also the period during which he witnessed, documented, and pondered the surprising revivals of the Great Awakening, as well as their precipitous decline. The notebook entries chronicle Edwards’ continuing fascination with the nature of saving faith and with faith’s culmination in the glories of heaven and the torments of hell. They also reflect his keen interest in defending Christianity’s reasonableness from enemies at home and abroad. A new theme emerges as Edwards expresses a growing sense of the deist threat and in numerous entries defends Christian doctrines by showing striking similarities between...",http://schema.org/EBook,2002-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Jonathan Edwards,Yale University Press,USD,0300091745,,,39.99

The author intends to bridge this gap with Toward an Exegetical Theology.

These instances of humor not only enliven the stories, they also provide the keys that he uses to address the scholarly riddles the book so frequently presents. Dr. Butler observes that Judges is a complex work of literature that cannot be easily reduced to a thesis sentence or to one single purpose statement. The central themes, though, are clear enough. Each story deals in one way or another with a crisis in leadership. The problem of disobedience also shadows leaders and people throughout the book. Political judgments color the way the stories are told, foreshadowing the later division of Israel into two warring kingdoms. Finally, despite the absence of any overt theological statements, the stories all point to the sovereignty of God over God's people, and the worship that they owe him.

He addresses the important topics of biblical exegesis and historical theology in Barth’s early writing, and develops his own line of interpretation of Barth’s theology in general. Webster suggests that the traditional accounts of Barth’s development are inadequate: they tend to emphasize his cultural and philosophical context, to focus on the same limited selection of his writings and to misjudge his theological intentions, regarding him as a purely transcendental thinker or as a postmodernist. In this book Webster provides detailed interpretations of early texts that have received little attention, such as Barth’s work on 1 Corinthians, on the Reformed Confessions, and on modern Protestant theology.

Paul and the Law: Keeping the Commandments of God (New Studies in Biblical Theology),"“For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God” (1 Corinthians 7:19).

Major positions are entrenched, yet none of them seems to know what to do with all the pieces of the puzzle.

The Message of Lamentations: Honest to God (BST),"The destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 587 BC is the likely setting for the book of Lamentations. This was the most traumatic event in all of Old Testament history, with its extreme human suffering, devastation of the ancient city, national humiliation, and the undermining of all that was thought to be theologically guaranteed like the Davidic monarchy, the city of Zion, and the temple of God of Israel. It is out of that unspeakable pain that Lamentations speaks in poetry of astonishing beauty and intricacy, though soaked in tears. If we neglect this book, says Christopher J.H. Wright, we miss the challenge and reward of wrestling with the massive theological issues that permeate it. How can suffering be endured alongside faith in an all-loving, good God? Even if these events are recognized and accepted as God’s judgment, has not the flood of brutality and evil gone beyond all bounds?

In developing criteria for such judgment he attacked at the same time one of the fundamental questions facing all religion: how to distinguish genuine from spurious piety? The Awakening created much bitter controversy; on the one side stood the emotionalists and enthusiasts, and on the other the rationalists, for whom religion was essentially a matter of morality or good conduct and the acceptance of properly formulated doctrine. Edwards, with great analytical skill and enormous biblical learning, showed that both sides were in the wrong. He attacked both a “lifeless morality” as too pale as to be the essence of religion, and he rejected the excesses of a purely emotional religion more concerned for sensational effects than for the inner transformation of the self, which was, for him, the center of genuine...",http://schema.org/EBook,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Jonathan Edwards,Yale University Press,USD,9780300158410,5.0,1.0,34.99

These include works from both Philo and Josephus, as well as the Biblical Antiquities, Jubilees, and the Apocalypse of Abraham.

Those who labor most successfully upon them generally confine themselves to outward facts, and don’t trace these facts back to their ultimate sources, or notice the variety of elements which go to form the final result. Hence, with A General View of the History of the English Bible, Westcott endeavors to rectify this oversight and fill an unfortunate gap in scholarship.

The question, says Warfield, is also worth asking of modernist skeptics, who assail the deity of Christ, strip the Gospel from the person of Jesus, domesticate the work of God, and unwittingly create a Christless Christianity. Warfield has little tolerance for modernist, deist, and pragmatist conceptions of Christ, and aims to reaffirm the position of the second person of the Trinity. Warfield begins with a comprehensive survey of Jesus in the Old Testament—present at creation, in the promises to the patriarchs, and in the words of the prophets. He also notes Jesus’ own words about himself in the New Testament, along with the early church’s conception of his humanity and deity. Warfield also tackles historical heresies about Jesus and warns of their tendency to periodically reappear in orthodox Christianity.

For an age still asking the question “who is Jesus?,” Leon Morris argues convincingly that John’s entire Gospel was written to show that the human Jesus is the Christ, or Messiah, as well as the Son of God.

By merging a careful study of Matthew’s gospel in relation to the social context of the ancient Mediterranean world with a detailed look at what we know of first-century Jewish-Christian relations, Craig Keener uncovers significant insights into the gospel not found in any other Matthew commentary. In addition, Keener’s commentary is a useful discipleship manual for the church. His approach recaptures the full “shock effect” of Jesus’ teachings in their original context and allows Matthew to make his point with greater narrative artistry. Keener also brings home the total impact of Matthew’s message, including its clear portrait of Jesus and its call for discipleship, both to the gospel’s ancient readers and to believers today. Thoroughly researched, the book includes a 150-page bi...",http://schema.org/EBook,2009-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Craig Keener,Eerdmans,USD,9780802864987,4.6,18.0,45.99

Christopher Wright is a proven interpreter and communicator of the Old Testament, and he masterfully opens our eyes to see and understand the message of Ezekiel.

Where Is Boasting?: Early Jewish Soteriology and Paul’s Response in Romans 1–5,"This important work challenges the validity of the “New Perspective” on Paul and Judaism. Working with new data from Jewish literature and a fresh reading of Romans 1–5, Simon Gathercole produces a far-reaching criticism of the current approach to Paul and points a new way forward. Building on a detailed examination of the past generation of scholarship on Paul and early Judaism, Gathercole’s work follows two paths. First, he shows that while early Judaism was not truly oriented around legalistic works-righteousness, it did consider obedience to the Law to be an important criterion at the final judgment. On the basis of this reconstruction of Jewish thought and a rereading of Romans 1–5, Gathercole advances his main argument–that Paul did indeed combat a Jewish perspective that saw obedience to the Law both as possible and as a criterion for vindication at the final judgment. Paul’s reply is that obedience to the Law is not a criterion for the final judgment because human nature mak...",http://schema.org/EBook,2002-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Simon Gathercole,Eerdmans,USD,9780802839916,,,35.99

Well apprised of the most recent developments, yet grounded in his own deep Reformed faith, Bloesch goes beneath current reconstructions of the Jesus of history to probe underlying issues of theological method, models of salvation, the plausibility of miracles, the language of faith and the doctrine of sin.

But more than that, we find, in the drama of Jonah, the charted course not just of this angular prophet but also of Israel’s attitude toward its most despised neighbor in the Mediterranean world. Jonah refuses to answer God’s call to go and proclaim judgement, because he knows God is the kind of God who responds in mercy and grace should the Assyrians repent.

Yet Leviticus was the first priority in Jewish instruction of the law of Moses. Jesus and His hearers knew Leviticus well and took its teachings to heart. The Documentary Hypothesis (separate JEDP portions later redacted) that reigned supreme over Pentateuchal studies for most of the twentieth century undercut the internal coherence of Leviticus that swayed the Jews of the New Testament period speculating that Leviticus was the nostalgic revisionist history of Judaic reformers in exile, rather than Leviticus originating with Moses. But more recently, such theories have fallen from favor, and Leviticus is being reconsidered for its historical representation of the ancient and foundational era of the Jews. Derek Tidball explores the picture in Leviticus of Israel being brought together under the law of Moses. Here is a definitive presentation of what life as the people...",http://schema.org/EBook,2005-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Derek Tidball,Inter-Varsity,USD,9781844740697,,,15.99

The Church celebrates seven sacraments: baptism, Eucharist, confirmation, matrimony, holy orders, confession, and anointing of the sick. Each was established by Jesus for the sake of salvation. When Jesus spoke of the sacraments, He made clear that they were essential: Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God (Jn 3:5) . . . unless you eat of the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, you have no life in you (Jn 6:53).",http://schema.org/EBook,2004-01-01T00:00:00Z,en,Scott Hahn,Doubleday,USD,0385509316,,,13.99

Joel Marcus examines in detail several important Markan passages which use the Old Testament. His central thesis is that Mark’s Old Testament usage follows paths already made by Jewish exegesis, particularly apocalyptic reinterpretations of Old Testament texts. Giving such eschatological exegesis his own characteristic twist, Mark presents Jesus as God’s true Messiah who brings the prophesied victory in eschatological holy war. Unlike the Jewish War against Rome in A.D. 66-72, however, the holy war portrayed by Mark is not fought with conventional weapons but won through the apocalyptic event of Jesus’ death and resurrection.

Engaging critically with Bart Ehrman, James Dunn, and other scholars, Bird demonstrates that a full-fledged adoptionist Christology did not emerge until the late second century. As he delves into passages often used to support the idea of an early adoptionist Christology, including Romans 1:3–4 and portions of the speeches in Acts, Bird persuasively argues that early Christology was in fact incarnational, not adoptionist.
