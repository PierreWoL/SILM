Pitfield London,"Stylish and accessible interiors shop Pitfield London is spread across a big double-fronted former office block, and is the retail arm of celebrated interior designer Shaun Clarkson. Clarkson (and business partner Paul Brewster) fill the space with pieces procured at home and abroad (the resourceful pair travel every month and raid local markets and manufacturers) and you’ll find all manner of stylish homewares, from brightly coloured 1970s sofas to vintage glasswear. Stock is replenished constantly, giving passers-by every reason to make a daily stop, if only to linger in its café which serves stacks of meringues and cakes with the papers. When we visited, an arty local sat by the window with a designer dog that we suspected might have been brought in for aesthetic effect.

Atelier Abigail Ahern,"This tiny interiors shop may not have a huge range, but what it lacks in quantity is more than made up for in quality. The selection is both inventive and original, with much of it from emerging international designers. A beautiful Kathy Dalwood concrete cast, part of a collection that focuses on historical characters, reinterprets 18th-century haute porcelain but retains mould lines from the casting process, indicating contemporary concerns about texture (from £320). British graduate Andrew Oliver is similarly playful, but with very different results; his lighting range (from £700) is a delightful addition to his drunken table range, unique one-off furniture pieces inspired by practical experimentation with salvaged furniture. Textiles are particularly strong; as well as some striking merino wool ottomans (£755), there are Impressionist paintings transposed on to linen by Argentinian-born artist Haby Bonomo (from £65). Colour ranges are muted but striking, summing up a store that’s a delightful departure from the sparse lines of many design stores.",,,Mon - Sat: 10:00 - 18:00 Sun: 12:00 - 17:00,,,,,

The shop is quite literally dark (the walls and lampshades black), creating a blank canvas for the carefully chosen selection of unisex fashion, accessories and interiors items on sale. Designer items include Borba Margo bags, DMK glassware and Solomia ceramics.

House of Hackney,"House of Hackney has made its first home, unsurprisingly, in its namesake borough – with an ambitious flagship store in the heart of Shoreditch. It’s one of the most gorgeous retail establishments to land in London in years – bedecked in the deliberately over the top juxtapositions of print-on-print-on-print that have made the brand’s name. The entrance to the store is filled with flora – luxury florists Wild at Heart have sublet the front of the shop and filled it with specially selected HoH flower selections. That rather sets the tone for the place, as things get even more flowery once you’re gliding across black polished floors, with Dalston rose wallpapers lined up cheek by jowl with palm prints, bee prints and more. All of House of Hackney’s beautiful print collections are here – represented upstairs in rolls of paper, fabric, trays, mugs, fashion and collaborative designs with brands like Puma. Downstairs you’ll find furniture – with generously proportioned sofas and plump armchairs in more-is-more combinations of print and texture.

The staff are friendly and knowledgeable (no moody, ‘I’m actually in a band’ hipsters serve here) and mix delectable elixirs like vodka and rhubarb with vanilla shrub and whisky with apricot jam and chocolate bitters (just ignore the names). The exposed brick walls, Milk Tray-coloured soft furnishings and abundance of tealights make Callooh Callay a very cosy spot to sit.

The Attendant,"Formerly a Victorian toilet, built around 1890 and mothballed in the 1960s, Attendant has been dormant for more than 50 years before being lovingly transformed into one of Europe’s most unique espresso and food bar spaces. After two years’ planning and restoration, the old Attendant’s office has been turned into a little seating area and the original porcelain urinals have become an inspired seating line with green seating to match the original Victorian floor tiles. Coffee We serve speciality coffee that we hand roast ourselves at the Campbell & Syme roastery in Finchley. Green coffee beans are sourced from single farms and estates where fair relationships are key. Milk Our organic milk comes from the Ivy House Farm in Somerset. This small farm has 120 Jersey cows, they rear their own calves and grow the feed for their cattle. Knowing that our milk has come from a farming family who care for their animals, we thought it was worth paying that little bit more for. Food Attendant’s food is made fresh daily and the menu changes seasonally. That’s our philosophy, and how we like to roll! Our head chef joined us after working under Nuno Mendes and creates exciting menu",,,Monday-Friday 8am-6pm Saturday 9am-6pm Sunday 10am - 5pm,,,,,

Liberty,"Liberty was founded in 1875, but the present Marlborough Street site, with its ships’ timbers and leaded windows, was built in the 1920s. The interconnecting jumble of rooms, with the odd fireplace and cushioned window seat, makes for an intimate feel – as if you’ve strayed into a private room in a stately house. It’s not an accident, founder Arthur Lasenby Liberty wanted customers to feel as if they were exploring someone’s home, keeping the shopping galleries small, albeit linked to three rather grand atriums. Although Liberty trades well on its history, it constantly squeezes innovation into its wood-panelled rooms. Alongside one of the best edits for fashion shopping in the world, in 2011 it expanded its men’s floor, adding a huge tailoring and accessories chamber packed full of posh undies. The Paper Room soon followed on the ground floor with micro-floral Liberty print stationery and gifts, and then the Dining Room opened – quirky cookware and gadgetry in a space modelled on the kitchen in Downton Abbey. French publishing powerhouse Assouline opened its Literary Lounge on the ground floor, where you can flick through fashion, art and photography coffee-table books (which are, oddly, the size of coffee tables).

Chicken Shop,"Once the remnants of the three birds had repaired to their doggy bags, talk at the table turned to the subject of very worst meal the three minors among us had eaten. I’ve no idea why, because generally this chat garnishes only a hideous meal. But after a heated debate the laurels went to “Dad’s pea risotto”. It’s no picnic, this parenting lark, is it? You slave your guts out so that you can treat them to high tea in history’s most happening fast-food joint, and your only reward is derision. The dishes come within minutes, so it was not long before the puddings arrived to dispel painful memories of that catastrophic risotto. A vast apple pie served in a farmhousey dish was nutmeggy, cinnamony and sensational.
