The Outrage,"The Outrage – A True Story, Aleksandr Ivanovich Kuprin. Kuprin wrote the story immediately after the bloody demonstrations in St. Petersburg, Russia, in January, 1905, known as “Bloody Sunday”—an event considered as the start of the first of three revolutions in Russia at the beginning of the twentieth century. The phenomenon of pogroms against the Jewish people in Russia fits into the overall picture of an unjust society. Kuprin was a liberally minded intellectual who, along with many others, often voiced his disagreement with government policies. The utterly unjust and inhumane treatment of the Jews as ready-made scapegoats for any misfortune, be it natural or otherwise, but mostly as a transparent excuse for the government’s own mistakes, caused many writers to voice similar protests.",,ru,Классическая проза,Александр Куприн The Outrage fb2 txt epub mobi pdf ipad android iphone ридер купить скачать бесплатно читать онлайн библиотека магазин книгалит литература жанр Классическая проза,Мультимедийное издательство Стрельбицкого,,RUB,49.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,Александр Куприн,0.0

There they entice their victims to join them for wild sexual escapades–all expressly forbidden, of course, by both Church and State.

The Queen's Necklace,"While French writer Alexandre Dumas is best-known for The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo, many critics consider his Marie-Antoinette novels to be his greatest achievement. Indeed, he was working on a dramatization of The Queen's Necklace at the time of his death in 1870. This was never published, but French playwright Pierre Decourcelle then produced his own version of this work. A successful dramatist, Decourcelle did a brilliant job of adapting Dumas's epic novel, salting the text with such larger-than-life figures as King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoninette, Cagliostro, and the Countess de la Motte. When the scandal surrounding the French court finally breaks, you have the feeling that you're actually there, watching the tragedy unfold before your eyes.

A Companion to the Biopic,"The most comprehensive reference text of theoretical and historical discourse on the biopic film The biopic, often viewed as the most reviled of all film genres, traces its origins to the early silent era over a century ago. Receiving little critical attention, biopics are regularly dismissed as superficial, formulaic, and disrespectful of history. Film critics, literary scholars and historians tend to believe that biopics should be artistic, yet accurate, true-to-life representations of their subjects. Moviegoing audiences, however, do not seem to hold similar views; biopics continue to be popular, commercially viable films. Even the genre’s most ardent detractors will admit that these films are often very watchable, particularly due to the performance of the lead actor. It is increasingly common for stars of biographical films to garner critical praise and awards, driving a growing interest in scholarship in the genre. A Companion to the Biopic is the first global and authoritative reference on the subject. Offering theoretical, historical, thematic, and performance-based approaches, this unique volume brings together the work of top scholars to discuss the coverage of the lives of authors, politicians, royalty, criminals, and pop stars through the biopic film.

Sylvandire: A Play in Four Acts,"In 1844-45, while Alexandre Dumas was working on his two classic novels, The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo, he found time to write a play called Sylvandire. A young provincial, Roger Tancred d'Anguilem, arrives in Paris to fight a legal battle for a huge inheritance. His opponent is an Indian called Afghano, who has bribed the judges. The case appears lost until Roger's approached by a sleazy lawyer who promises him success–but only if he marries a woman sight unseen. Sylvandire, his new wife, turns out to be a stunning beauty, but the marriage is intended to deliver his spouse as the unwilling mistress of a royal favorite, who can imprison Roger if he resists.

Queen Margot: A Play in Five Acts,"Written in 1847, while Dumas was at the height of his powers, this play recounts the events leading up to the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre of the French Huguenots–and the subsequent death of King Charles IX. The playwright focuses on the people inadvertently caught up in the slaughter–which, once started, cannot be repressed. By following the fate of two nobles, the Catholic Count Coconnas and the Huguenot Count de la Mole, and linking their stories to Queen Marguerite (called Margot), wife in name only to the Huguenot King of Navarre (the future King Henry IV of France), Dumas reveals the terror and duplicity that the massacre incurred even at the highest levels of society–including the royal family.

It was followed by “The Vicomte de Bragelonne”, which was first serialized in 1847.
