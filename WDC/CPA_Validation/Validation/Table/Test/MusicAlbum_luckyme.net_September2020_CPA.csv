IT READS \""From the start, nobody knew what to make of it. It looked like nothing anyone had ever seen. Scientists rushed to study it, artists to capture it, mystics to worship it. They all thought they could know it, claim it. But the longer you looked at it, the more it would change. By the time they thought they had figured it out, it was something else. I tried to take a picture that first day, but the photo just came out black. All we knew was that it was here now. And by the second day, as it hung there in the sky, iridescent and massive, it suddenly seemed familiar, even friendly. And we knew its name, we woke with it on our minds like a strange dream.

Friends with us since the inception of the record label over a decade ago - playing early shows alongside us in Glasgow and London. In the years since, we’ve come to spend more time in Jason’s native Los Angeles, and reconnecting in 2019, it felt natural to work together on a new phase that casts light on a producer who has had a quietly influential stamp on popular music and live production. Our announcement is paired with the drop of the new single “For The Light”: a live house record, with vocals by Nosaj Thing and additional instruments by Michael Andrews.",For The Light,https://shop.luckyme.net/release/202450-nosaj-thing-for-the-light,"['$1.35', '$1.99', '$2.19']"
"['Kids Return Sweatshirt', 'LuckyMe']","Kids Return (キッズ・リターン Kizzu Ritān) is a 1996 Japanese film written, edited and directed by Takeshi Kitano. The film was made directly after Kitano recovered from a motorcycle wreck that left one side of his body paralyzed. After extensive surgery and physical therapy he quickly went about making Kids Return amidst speculation that he might never be able to work again. The movie is about two high school dropouts, Masaru (Ken Kaneko) and Shinji (Masanobu Andō), who try to find a direction and meaning in their lives—one by becoming a yakuza lieutenant, the other by becoming a boxer. The music was composed by Joe Hisaishi, and the cinematographer was Katsumi Yanagishima. Kids Return is also the name of a song on the LuckyMe Advent Calendar 2018.

Dawn Chorus (Deluxe),"Last year we released “Dawn Chorus” — Jacques Greene’s stunning sophomore album which tracks the melancholy and euphoria of the sunrise following the club. Pitchfork wrote: \""Pushing beyond his customary dancefloor focus, the French-Canadian producer twists club influences and collaborative input into a textured, exploratory sound, both intimate and immense” and that this “ushered in a new era for Jacques Greene without losing sight of his unique sentimentality.\"" The album showed Greene outgrowing the limitations of the tempo-defined dance genres he rose to notoriety within. And while his own music grew in scope, Dawn Chorus became his most collaborative work: courting friends and instrumentalists to lend their work to the album. For that reason, Dawn Chorus feels so much richer than his prior, solitary bedroom production and spoke to Greene’s competence as a curator. Now, three months after the original release we are proud to present an expanded album with x12 new original remixes which speaks to his ability for curation in a whole other sense: building on the album with club primetime house and techno, afterparty warehouse versions, IDM, shoegaze and fully deconstructed ambient by a crew of Greene’s friends and family.","['Stars', 'Sel (Cameron Morse Remix)', 'Understand', 'For Love (JD Twitch Remix)', 'Stars (Ciel’s Geary Ave Remix)', 'Serenity', 'Understand (dj lostboi Remix)', 'Do It Without You (Nathan Micay Remix)', 'Distance', 'Sibling (Patrick Holland Remix)', 'Drop Location', 'Night Service (Fort Romeau Remix)', 'For Love', 'Serenity (Martyn Bootyspoon Remix)', 'Do It Without You', 'Sel', 'Let Go (Big Miz Remix)', 'Night Service', 'Whenever', 'Night Service (Fort Romeau Dub)', 'Whenever (CFCF Remix)', 'Sibling', 'Let Go', 'Drop Location (Lunice Remix)']",https://shop.luckyme.net/release/166013-jacques-greene-dawn-chorus-deluxe,"['$12.99', '$14.49']"

Remote Sympathy,"LuckyMe are proud to present ‘Remote Sympathy’– the new album and first ever physical release from the enigmatic Scottish artist Sevendeaths. Sevendeaths is the alias of Edinburgh-based musician, producer, and composer Steven Shade. ‘Remote Sympathy’ is his greatest body of work yet and the first committed to vinyl. An album of cinematic, synth-epic drone music - created during long nights of sleep deprivation. The record is a tribute to life and human strength and an acceptance of the frailty of the human spirit. Here he sounds the depths of the human psyche, creating a brutal maelstrom where dense slabs of noise gyre. But this is not a record only of fear and darkness – there is hope and light here too, soaring melodies amid the tumult. Employing noise as metaphor for information overload, Shade questions how technology creates fragmented selves. Who are we now, in the era of the internet? And how can we give voice to ourexperience, now both totalizing and discordant?

Writing to picture was an eye opening experience as i began to see my own music in a totally new light. Watching it come to life in a way I’d never seen before, it all just kind of clicked. It taught me how the use of space is so important in working with film and how saying a little can really go a long way in some instances. I performed the soundtrack at the Edinburgh International Festival & the Unheard Film Festival in Amsterdam, and came back to New York intent on completing ‘Vignettes’ as its own record - this time drawn from scenes in my imagination and inspired by my first adventures in film” Mike Slott 2020","['Milky Oceans', 'Simple Dreams of Simple Days', 'Falling Through', 'Tabriz', 'Letting Go', 'Keep Me Here', 'Testing Ground']",https://shop.luckyme.net/release/178275-mike-slott-vignettes,"[['$7.99', '$6.99'], '$14.00']"

Positive Noise,"Positive Noise, the debut album by Sam O.B, is not a 'journey of a record', but it's also not Party Time USA. It's nuance: cloud patterns: like good progressive jazz. Like the refinement of refinement, the elegance of elegance. Sound propelled by its own smoothness. A coolness that isn’t cold. The earnestness of an old friend. Expanse. Experimentation. Actual warmth. Sam O.B. is (and has always been) a man of classics. When you hear the sax on ‘Salt Water,’ you will understand this ambition with precision. Arpeggiated horn delay and female oohs fall like geodesic rain. The blasting synth leads on ‘Midnight Blue’ and 'Nearness’ waver and find their way (“Always on time”). The sing-and-play harmonies of ‘Sirens’ refer to the stunning bliss of smooth jazz, which has been in Sam’s arsenal of interests for longer than anyone can remember.","['237 AM', 'Firefly', 'Common Ground', 'Nearness', 'Balance', 'Salt Water', 'Midnight Blue', 'Sirens', 'Revolve', 'Samurai']",https://shop.luckyme.net/release/85987-sam-ob-positive-noise,"[['$12.99', '$22.00'], ['$11.99', '$9.99']]"

His music for this label received multiple ‘best of years.’ Even a ‘track of the decade.’ But over the last year he's finally been able to complete his debut long form album.

Those fleeting moments of transcendence one finds in nightclubs with friends. Flickering physical connections with loved ones.

Blue Spring,"The debut album from Toronto born, Berlin based DJ/producer Nathan Micay FKA Bwana The impeccable craft found in the huge past anthems that fuelled his rise is still present, but Micay has upped his own ante; a prodigious and natural creator, this is his best work yet. Highly melodic with complex but spacious sound design, this inspired work is a technicolour ride across sub bass, celestial future breakbeat, drum-roll-fuelled dancefloor rollercoasters, soaring euphoria, otherworldly soundscapes, weightless sino and even a bit of ¾ time. Micay has found a sweet-spot between prog, trance, techno, hardcore, jungle, IDM and ambient, in a renewed twist on the magic mix that birthed Future Sound of London’s hybrid classic ‘Accelerator’. To create the album artwork, Nathan wrote a script outline, which was adapted by Peter Marsden into a comic, in turn illustrated by Dominic Flannigan, in tribute to the highly-influential Manga artist Katsuhiro Otomo.

S-Type has been a part of the catalytic Scottish hip hop scene for the best part of a decade, sharing demos with peers Hudson Mohawke and Rustie, while honing a potent, colourful sound of his own. Apparently the American R&B and hip hop execs are already knocking on his door, and it's no wonder when you've heard the beats on his 'Billboard EP'. From the top it's a powerful display of aptitude, bursting in with the polychromatic fireworks of 'Billboard' and the knock-out MPC hits of 'Flyp City', while 'Sensi Star' fires ultrafunked arpeggios and tender piano keys from the hip.
