Needless, to say the housing market was difficult to be a buyer in with all of the competition and lack of inventory. However, Christy completely understood what we were looking for and was able to notify us before homes even went on the market in order to see them first and avoid the competition. The sale of our home also went very smoothly as we were under contract very soon after putting the home on the market, with no hiccups all the way until closing. During this process of buying and selling with Christy, Maria was pregnant with out first child and we had a lot to do in a short amount of time.

On our trips every few months, she showed us communities and options, always opening up more choices and emailing info on properties that might interest us. When we showed interest in a particular community, she put us in touch with residents, so we could hear about their experience firsthand, and ask questions.

When we saw a house we were interested in on-line, she went to the house and walked us through it by face-timing with us while we were in NY. When we finally found our new home, she arranged to meet with the inspector and appraiser for the walk thrus and acted on our behalf.

She put some furniture in but added clever notes describing what to do that day, for example, a pair of used tennis shoes (cute ones) by the door with a note about where to go since the cherry creek trail is 1/2 a block away.

If you are buying a house or refinancing Cindy is the person you want to work with', 'Cindy was a pleasure to work with and helped with all of our questions and was extremely professional.', 'STRONGLY RECOMMEND Ms Cindy MacDonell, Senior Loan Officer.Frustrated with the process in traditional mortgage financing, I was exploring hard money lending options. I knew I could make payments on a condo that I really liked, I had a stable job in higher education. Few years back, I had hit a snag in my life which showed on my credit report. However I had bounced back and made improvements in my credit profile. I was looking for a loan agent who could see a holistic view of my situation. A hard money lender referred me to Ms Cindy MacDonell with a note,”If anyone can make my loan work, it would be Cindy.” This was a blessing indeed ! In Cindy, I had found a very intelligent, patient and dedicated loan officer. I recall the morning I had called her. Cindy had not slept the night before due to family reasons, however, she postponed her sleep and began working on my loan with urgency. I was really touched by her dedication and a relationship of trust was established right there. I wish to highlight that Cindy is very thorough and communicates well as the loan process unfolds. What I like about her']",CA
