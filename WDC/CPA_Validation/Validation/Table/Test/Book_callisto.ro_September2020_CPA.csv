Handbook of Physics in Medicine and Biology,"In considering ways that physics has helped advance biology and medicine, what typically comes to mind are the various tools used by researchers and clinicians. We think of the optics put to work in microscopes, endoscopes, and lasers; the advanced diagnostics permitted through magnetic, x-ray, and ultrasound imaging; and even the nanotools, that allow us to tinker with molecules. We build these instruments in accordance with the closest thing to absolute truths we know, the laws of physics, but seldom do we apply those same constants of physics to the study of our own carbon-based beings, such as fluidics applied to the flow of blood, or the laws of motion and energy applied to working muscle. Instead of considering one aspect or the other, Handbook of Physics in Medicine and Biology explores the full gamut of physics’ relationship to biology and medicine in more than 40 chapters, written by experts from the lab to the clinic. The book begins with a basic description of specific biological features and delves into the physics of explicit anatomical structures starting with the cell. Later chapters look at the body's senses, organs, and systems, continuing to explain biological functions in the language of physics.",9780367384319,Robert Splinter,548,,CRC PRESS,302.4,RON,2020.0

Practical Handbook of Neurosurgery 3 volumes set From Leading Neurosurgeons,"“Practical Handbook of Neurosurgery” invites readers to take part in a journey through the vast field of neurosurgery, in the company of internationally renowned experts. At a time when the discipline is experiencing a (detrimental) tendency to segment into various subfields and scatter in the process, it can be worthwhile to collect a number of practical lessons gleaned from experienced and leading neurosurgeons. The book also aims to present numerous important figures in the neurosurgical community, with a brief overview of the vitae and main contributions for each. We must confess that we were sad that some of the most active members were unable to participate, likely due to time constraints. We are however fortunate that the majority were able to take part. As such, though not exhaustive, the book does represent an anthology of contemporary neurosurgeons. From the preface: At the very beginning of the project, our intention was to make a “poetbook”. But month after month it became obvious that the work would be much more expansive; ultimately we produced three volumes. Nevertheless we hope that all the three volumes together will remain easily accessible and a daily companion.

As objective response is limited to a subset of patients and is often associated with distinct immune related side effects that are potentially life threatening, it is essential to identify patients who are likely to respond to immunotherapy and those who are at a risk for developing treatment-related side effects. In the absence of a validated predictive biomarker, innovative technologies and assays are being used to identify critical biomarkers that drive the immune response. Hence, a chapter to provide a basic understanding of the diagnostic procedures has been included besides the chapter on the cellular components of the human immune system. This new edition will also inform readers",978-3-030-41007-0,"Naing, Aung, Hajjar, Joud (Eds.)",339,3.0,Springer Verlag,981.75,RON,2020.0
Atlas of electroencephalography Volume 2: The Epilepsies,"Fully revised and updated, this second edition includes more than 2/3 new high-quality digital figures. A new Classification approach to epilepticseizures and to the epilepsies became official in 2017. Several aspects in terms of terminology have been included in this book and most of the chapters have been rewritten. This volume focuses on epilepsies in their diversity. It is richly illustrated, and each EEG plate is analyzed in order to highlight the most significant elements to be used both for the diagnosis and interpretation. The originality of this textbook lies in its patient-based approach, thereby avoiding the pitfall of a formal presentation of EEG documents without their clinical context. Hence electroencephalography is placed at the core of the diagnostic and therapeutic discussion concerning patients with epilepsy. Given the practical orientation of this Atlas, the focus is on common forms of epilepsies; nevertheless, some less common, more intriguing forms have also been illustrated. ◊ A synthetic text summarizes the present approach to the main epilepsy categories. This Atlas is designed for all the actors who may be involved with patients with epilepsy.

Pulmonary Function Testing Principles and Practice,"This book serves as a unique, comprehensive resource for physicians and scientists training in pulmonary medicine and learning about pulmonary function testing. Pulmonary function testing and the physiological principles that underlie it are often poorly understood by medical students, residents, fellows and graduate students training in the medical sciences. One reason is that students tend to get overwhelmed by the basic mathematical descriptions that explain the working of the respiratory system and the principles of pulmonary function testing. Another reason is that too many approaches focus on the math without explaining the clinical relevance of these principles and the laboratory testing that enables us to measure the very lung function that these principles are describing. This book answers that need by providing a series of chapters that guide the reader in a natural order of learning about the respiratory system. In particular, after a general overview of the structure-function design of the lung and the history of pulmonary function testing, authors begin with the drive to breathe, and then follow the pathway of air as it is drawn into the lung, undergoes gas exchange, and is then exhaled back out again.

Developmental Epilepsy From Clinical Medicine to Neurobiological Mechanisms,"This is a collection of chapters from renowned authors focused on the contemporary issues in developmental epilepsy, from both clinical and basic science perspectives. Developmental epilepsy (or epilepsy syndromes), while receiving much more attention than 20 years ago, is still not well understood. This lag in research is reflected in the challenges of treating developmental epilepsy. The book discusses these challenges in the clinic and brings them back to the laboratory bench (and in some cases back to the bedside). This book fills a gap in the literature on developing epilepsy by bridging current clinical knowledge with basic and translational research in the developing brain relevant for developmental epilepsy. The book is introduced by a chapter on brain development to provide a background for understanding when and how seizures and epilepsy can emerge. Recent clinical research indicates strong relationship between childhood epilepsy and developmental cognitive impairment. This connection can be studied in experimental animals and can uncover developmental mechanisms common to both conditions. Targeting those mechanisms might reveal disease-modifying treatments. Febrile seizures are very common in the pediatric population and their impact on further epilepsy development is explored.

Immunology and Serology,"Immunology and Serology are two major science fields. Immunology is defined as the study of the molecules, cells, organs, and systems responsible for the recognition and disposal of foreign material. Immunology began as a branch of microbiology. The study of infectious disease and the body's response to them has a major role for the development of immunology. Moreover, the concept of germ theory of disease has contributed to the field of immunology. It was Edward Jenner who first studied the response of the body to foreign substances. He observed that dairy maids who had naturally contracted a mild infection called cowpox seemed to be protected against smallpox, a horribly disfiguring disease and a major killer. Serology is the diagnostic identification of antibodies in the serum and other bodily fluids.

Handbook of Tumor Syndromes,"Tumors/cancers are characterized by uncontrolled growths of abnormal cells that extend beyond their usual boundaries and disrupt the normal functions of affected organs and systems. While about 75%–80% of tumors/cancers arise sporadically without a family connection, 20%–25% appear to be familial (including 10%–15% nonhereditary familial tumors [or familial tumors] and 5%–10% hereditary familial tumors [or hereditary tumors]). As nonhereditary and hereditary familial tumors often show both tumor-related and non-tumor-related (or syndromic) symptoms, they are referred to as tumor syndromes (or cancer susceptibility syndromes). In comparison with sporadic tumors/cancers, tumor syndromes (>300 described so far) tend to occur at a younger age, involve multiple organs and systems, produce multiple (often in a distinct spectrum) and bilateral lesions, form multiple hamartomatous, benign, or precursor lesions; locate in specific site(s), display unique syndromic features, and affect multiple members/generations of a family.

Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy Over Time,"Aloneness in the face of overwhelming emotion is at the center of emotional suffering. Undoing aloneness is thus key to being able to process the emotions of trauma and reap the benefits of the adaptive resources that come with those emotions. AEDP (accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy) is a healing-oriented, mind–body psychotherapy that seeks to put positive neuroplasticity into action, undo the client's aloneness, and cocreate a safe relationship as early in the therapeutic relationship as possible. Thus accompanied, and with the dyadic affect regulation of what formerly was too much to deal with, the client can process those overwhelming emotions. Characteristic AEDP interventions include being on the lookout for glimmers of healing, undoing the client's isolation, and using metatherapeutic processing to work through the experience of transformation to systematically support the client's flourishing, resilience, and well-being. Over the course of six therapy sessions, Dr. Diana Fosha demonstrates AEDP's intimate, moment-to-moment work with a client suffering from intense unresolved traumatic emotions. In their work together, Dr. Fosha helps the client not only experientially process negative emotions, she also uses metatherapeutic processing to systematically work with the client's positive emotions to make the most their potential.

Paediatric Electromyography,"Electromyography (EMG) is a diagnostic modality that offers enormous value to the investigation of neuromuscular disease. It is able to quickly identify abnormalities which, if they have to be identified by other means, require more expensive or more painful methods of investigation, such as muscle biopsy. However, despite its diagnostic/prognostic value, electromyography is often avoided in children, often due to the misconception that the investigation is too painful or too difficult to be performed in paediatric patients. Paediatric Electromyography will attempt to dispel many of the misconceptions about paediatric EMG by drawing on the author's extensive experience in treating patients using this technique at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. The book includes a very clear and well illustrated description of the basic neurophysiology essential to any person practising EMG, and the differences in the performance and interpretation of the tests in children are highlighted.",9780198754596,Matthew Pitt,320,,Oxford University Press,538.65,RON,2017.0

Sciatica and Piriformis Syndrome,"This book reveals the real cause of sciatica pain and how you can treat it simply and effectively at home. Do you suffer from back pain that radiates out into your legs? You are not alone. Roughly one in three people suffers from the same. Traditionally, doctors automatically suspect a slipped disc but intervertebral discs aren’t always to blame. In many cases, there is an infection in the piriformis muscles that presses on the sciatica nerve that is causing the pain. If piriformis syndrome is recognised early, it can be much more precisely and effectively treated than, for instance, a slipped disc. Even simple stretching poses have proven astonishingly effective. Sports editor Nicolai Napolski, who knows from his own experience how painful piriformis syndrome can be, has come together with sports therapist and personal trainer Katharina Brinkmann to write the first guidebook covering this condition in a clear and concise manner. Not only have the authors collected the most important information regarding the background and development of piriformis syndrome, but they have also created their very own training concept that introduces simple and effective techniques which can be used to stretch the shortened muscles, strengthen the pelvic girdle and correct",9781905367849,NICOLAI NAPOLSKI & KATHARINA BRINKMANN,112,,Lotus Publishing,52.5,RON,2020.0

The Telemachus Complex: Parents and Children after the Decline of the Father,"Fatherhood today is in crisis. Fathers have gone missing, or have become their children’s playmates, and the symbolic authority of the father has lost its power. For many, the decline of the traditional pater familias is no bad thing – his time has passed. But what remains of the father today in the wake of this decline, and what should the relation between children and parents now be? In addressing these questions, psychoanalyst and bestselling author Massimo Recalcati draws inspiration from the story of Telemachus in Homer’s Odyssey. The Telemachus complex is the reverse of the Oedipus complex. Recalcati argues that children are possessed not just with a desire to annihilate their father, as their key rival in the contest to win the mother’s love, but also with a longing for a father-figure, as someone who brings meaning, structure and order to their lives and who imbues them with a sense of the future. But this desire on the part of children needs to be reconfigured so that it can find solace in the longing, hope in the anticipation, and relief in the expectation. Whether the father arrives is less important than the children’s own journey of belief in a",978-1-509-53172-1,"Massimo Recalcati, Alice Kilgarriff",160,,WILEY,94.5,RON,2019.0

"Clinical Reasoning and Decision Making in Physical Therapy Facilitation, Assessment, and Implementation","Clinical reasoning is an essential non-negotiable element for all health professionals. The ability of the health professional to demonstrate professional competence, compassion, and accountability depend on a foundation of sound clinical reasoning. The clinical reasoning process needs to bring together knowledge, experience, and understanding of people, the environment, and organizations along with a strong moral compass in making sound decisions and taking necessary actions. While clinical reasoning and the role of mentors has been a focus of the continued growth and development of residency programs in physical therapy, there is a critical need to have a broader, in-depth look at how educators across academic and clinical settings intentionally facilitate the development of clinical reasoning skills across one's career. Clinical Reasoning and Decision Making in Physical Therapy: Facilitation, Assessment, and Implementation fills this need by providing a comprehensive and in-depth focus on development of the patient-client management skills of clinical reasoning and clinical decision-making.

Textbook of Vascular Medicine,"This textbook focuses on the vascular biology and physiology that underlie vascular disorders in clinical medicine. Vascular biomedicine is a rapidly growing field as new molecular mechanisms of vascular health and disease are unraveled. Many of the major cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke and vascular dementia are diseases of the vasculature. In addition vascular injury underpins conditions like kidney failure and cardiovascular complications of diabetes. This field is truly multidisciplinary involving scientists in many domains such as molecular and vascular biology, cardiovascular physiology and pharmacology and immunology and inflammation. Clinically, specialists across multiple disciplines are involved in the management of patients with vascular disorders, including cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, neurologists and vascular surgeons.

"Endoscopy in Early Gastrointestinal Cancers, Volume 2 Treatment","Endoscopy in Early Gastrointestinal Cancers, Volume 2: Treatment covers the detailed information of the indications, techniques and perioperative management of endoscopic resection including endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract remained a major health issue worldwide, which is, however notoriously difficult to treat. Endoscopic resection for early neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract had been developed for more than 25 years. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a recently developed technique pioneer by Japanese endoscopists. The principle of ESD is to achieve a complete resection of gastrointestinal neoplasia limited to mucosa with adequate circumferential margins. This novel endoscopic technique not only allows the achievement of en-bloc resection for early GI cancers, it also conveys a significantly lower rate of local recurrence as compared to EMR for early gastric cancers. There is an urge for the knowledge in applying these novel technologies for the treatment of early GI neoplasia worldwide. This book on the endoscopic treatment of early GI neoplasia, containing lots of illustrations, artwork and numerous short video clips, serves as a bridge between the recent development in endoscopy and the knowledge of gastroenterologist, endoscopist and surgeons.",978-981-10-6777-8,"Chiu, P.W., Sano, Y., Uedo, N., Singh, R.

"The Urinary Bladder: Structure, Functions and Clinical Aspects","The Urinary Bladder: Structure, Functions and Clinical Aspects describes the detailed anatomy of the bladder, including its external and internal features, vasculature and lymphatic drainage, as well as its nerve supply. More than 90% of bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas; the remaining are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Approximately 75% of urothelial carcinomas are non-muscle invasive bladder cancers. Although promising biomarkers have been identified for urinary bladder cancer, none of them are used clinically due to limited validation and relatively low sensitivity and specificity. As such, the authors presents an overview of the recent developments in aberrant DNA methylation, one of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression. Additionally, new developments concerning the role of polymorphisms in glutathione gene family enzyme transferases are reviewed in the context of susceptibility to urinary bladder cancer. Immunotherapy, a novel promising targeted therapy for cancer treatment, is reviewed. Several approaches contributing to tumor recognition and cell death by the immune system have been adopted in oncology, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, tumor vaccines, small molecules, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells.

Movement Integration The Systemic Approach to Human Movement,"A paradigm-shifting, integrative approach to understanding body movement The ability to move with efficiency and agility has been an essential component to our evolution and survival as a species. It has enabled us to find food, fight threats, flee danger, and flourish both individually and collectively. Our body’s intricate network of bones, muscles, tissues, and organs moves with great complexity. While traditional anatomy has relied on a reductionist frame for understanding these mechanisms in isolation, the contributors to Movement Integration take a more systemic, integrative approach. Ensomatosy is a new paradigm for comprehending movement from the perspective of the body s entirety. The body’s many systems are understood as synchronized both internally and externally. Drawing on expertise in physiotherapy, somatics, sports science, Rolfing, myofascial therapy, craniosacral therapy, Pilates, and yoga, the authors assert that a more comprehensive understanding of movement is key to restoring the body’s natural ability to move fluidly and painlessly. With over 150 colour images, the Color Illustration Model provides a visual tool for understanding how joints interact with surrounding structures (rather than in isolation). This is an ideal book for physiotherapists, massage therapists, structural integrators, coaches, as well as yoga and Pilates instructors.",9781905367955,LINUS JOHANSSON & MARTIN LUNDGREN,232,,Lotus Publishing,147.0,RON,2020.0

Precision Medicine in Oncology,"Most medical treatments have been designed for the “average patient.” As a result of this “one-size-fits-all-approach,” treatments can be very successful for some patients but not for others. This is changing with the emergence of precision medicine, an innovative approach to disease prevention and treatment that takes into account individual differences in people’s genes, environments, and lifestyles. Precision medicine gives clinicians tools to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying a patient’s health, disease, or condition, and to better predict which treatments will be most effective. Precision or personalized medicine in cancer treatment was once a buzzword, but it is finally becoming a reality with recent advances in imaging, genetic, and biological sciences. The importance of interpatient and intratumor variability has long been recognized, but realistic opportunities to take these into account in cancer care have emerged only recently. Innovations in patient characterization through genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have opened new avenues to personalize cancer treatment in ways that were not possible before. Furthermore, advances in quantitative assessment of therapeutic response, as provided by functional and molecular imaging, have been critical in the implementation of precision medicine paradigm in radiation oncology.

"Practical Paediatric Prescribing, How to Prescribe the Most Common Drugs","Prescribing for children is problematic. Children are not small adults in terms of their physiology, and they cannot be subjects in clinical trials. This makes prescribing for them something of an art and a daunting one at that for trainees.

Pharmacology of Immunotherapeutic Drugs,"Medicine has entered a golden age in which therapeutic agents are becoming widely available due to advances in basic science and technology. As such, many drugs have been developed that target inflammatory processes and/or the immune system. This book is intended for health professionals examining the modulation of inflammation by immunotherapeutic drugs. The immune system fills the primordial role of host defense and resistance to infections with pathogenic microorganisms. Several hematopoietic-derived cells constituting the innate and adaptive immune systems cooperate to provide barriers for microbial colonization and/or promote pathogen destruction within the host. Conversely, many immune cells are also involved in the pathogenesis and propagation of chronic inflammatory diseases. The beginning of this book details various components of the immune system including the cell types, lymphoid tissues, soluble cytokines and surface molecules that are essential for host defense. Breakdowns in immune tolerance, or dysregulated immune responses to antigens derived from self tissues or innocuous sources, can lead to the development of autoimmunity or chronic inflammatory diseases. Pathophysiologic roles for the immune system are detailed in corresponding chapters on autoimmunity, epithelial surfaces (lungs, skin, intestine), and transplantation, with special emphasis placed on immunotherapeutic drug targets.

It also highlights the clinical-pathophysiological importance of AKI in clinical settings, including differential diagnoses and management of AKI. In the past, the pathology associated with sudden renal impairment was characterized as acute renal failure (ARF). However, in the 2000s, the joint efforts of specialists in fields including nephrology, intensive care medicine, and cardiovascular medicine led to the introduction of a novel concept known as acute kidney injury (AKI). As medical care progressed, patients such as high-risk elderly subjects who were not deemed to be candidates for invasive therapy came to be treated in intensive care units (ICUs). As a result, kidney injury as a subset of multiple organ failure was re-considered as AKI, especially in intensive care medicine. AKI was then proposed as a novel disease concept to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and early intervention to improve prognosis. Presenting novel features, such as the definition of AKI, risk factors and management; biomarkers, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and L-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP); long-term outcomes",978-981-15-1107-3,"Terada, Yoshio, Wada, Takashi, Doi, Kent (Eds.)",396,,Springer Verlag,935.55,RON,2020.0

This highly detailed book, including videoclip on epidural technique, offers comprehensive coverage on epidurals; as such, it will appeal to all anesthesiologists, especially obstetric anesthesiologists.",978-3-030-45331-2,"Capogna, Giorgio",240,,Springer Verlag,585.9,RON,2020.0
Evidence-Based Emergency Imaging Optimizing Diagnostic Imaging of Patients in the Emergency Care Setting,"This book presents evidence-based criteria to systematically assess the appropriate use of medical imaging in the emergency department and other acute care settings. ​Over the last decade, there have been profound changes in the diagnostic testing and work-up of patients presenting to the emergency department with emergent symptoms. One of the most far-reaching changes has been the increased availability, speed, and accuracy of imaging due, in part, to technical improvements in imaging modalities such as CT, MR, and PET. Although the use of high-end imaging has plateaued in general, increased utilization continues in the ED. These patients are more acutely ill and there is additional pressure to make an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible to facilitate prompt disposition or treatment. There is also strong evidence for the beneficial use of imaging in the emergency setting that results in improved patient outcomes.

ELISA Theory and Practice,"ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) revolutionized the way to detect antibodies and antigens, by using an enzymatic system instead of radioactive labelling. This technique has been widely used since its development for disease diagnostics and other purposes. A quick Pubmed search will give you more than 23000 manuscripts peer-reviewed and published, using this assay. The ELISA technique was conceptualized and developed by Peter Perlmann, and Eva Engvall at Stockholm University, Sweden. Engvall and Perlmann published their first paper on ELISA in 1971. Solid-phase techniques were used in the development of microtiter plates (96 wells) in which either an antigen or an antibody is non-covalently bound to a solid-phase support. Technical advances led to automated pipetting devices (Micromedics; Hamilton), multichannel pipettes (Lab Systems), and microtiter plate readers and washers, and in the 1980s fully automated test instruments were manufactured by Boehringer-Mannheim and Abbott, among others. Such automated systems have come to stay in medical laboratories. This book starts by introducing the ELISA history and the three different main forms of the assay, Direct, Indirect, and Sandwich ELISA. It continues with a general overview of different ELISA methods using LPS, peptides as antigens and urine the sample for diagnosis (Section 1).

Recent textbooks have tended to focus on such specialized topics as the coalescent, molecular evolution, human population genetics, or genomics. This primer bucks that trend by encouraging a broader familiarity with, and understanding of, population genetics and genomics as a whole. The overview ranges from mating systems through the causes of evolution, molecular population genetics, and the genomics of complex traits. Interwoven are discussions of ancient DNA, gene drive, landscape genetics, identifying risk factors for complex diseases, the genomics of adaptation and speciation, and other active areas of current research. The principles are illuminated by numerous examples from a wide variety of animals, plants, microbes, and human populations. The approach also emphasizes learning by doing, which in this case means solving numerical or conceptual problems. The rationale behind this is that the use of concepts in problem-solving lead to deeper understanding and longer knowledge retention. This accessible, introductory textbook is aimed principally at students of various levels and abilities (from senior undergraduate to postgraduate) as well as practising scientists in the",9780198862307,Daniel L.

Emergency Surgery in Obese Patients,"This comprehensive, multi-authored book covers all aspects of surgery on obese patients in emergency conditions. Obesity is a metabolic disease affecting a high percentage of world population.. It involves marked anthropometric changes, affecting surgical practice and altering patients’ ability to react to surgical stress.

Allicin: The Natural Sulfur Compound from Garlic with Many Uses,"Allicin is the major active sulfur-containing moiety that is released when garlic cloves are crushed or damaged. Since its first recorded use in ancient times to ward off snakebites and by the physician Hippocrates to treat pneumonia and heal wounds, allicin has come a long way and its attributes now include antimicrobial and anti-insecticidal activities. Given the rapid appearance of resistant microbes and insects, allicin clearly has merit in these spheres, even more so as resistance does not appear following its usage. More recently allicin has been successfully used as a complementary treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases, which include type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and even certain tumors. Having a “natural” medicine, which is associated with an absence of side effects, can only be beneficial in conditions requiring long-term usage and it is clear that allicin’s potential as an individual or adjunct medicine needs to be evaluated. The gold standard for phase III human studies are double blind randomized placebo controlled trials and allicin’s success in this area is just beginning to be realized.

Alzheimer's Disease and Infectious Causes The Theory and Evidence,"With the recent discovery that amyloid beta protein, the cause of plaques in Alzheimer's disease, is an antimicrobial peptide produced in response to infection, many researchers are focusing on the role infection plays in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Brain studies have also identified a number of different viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa in the postmortem brain specimens of Alzheimer's patients. Infection (particularly chronic, latent and persistent infections) causes an immune response that leads to inflammation and brain cell degeneration, which are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease. Sources of infection in Alzheimer's disease vary from childhood infections to gut microbes that find their way into the brain as a result of aging, leaky gut syndrome, and increased permeability of the blood brain barrier. Studies and ongoing clinical trials show that treatment of viral and bacterial infections, as well as restoring a healthy balance to the gut microbiome, can reduce disease risk and improve symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This book serves as an introduction to the human microbiome and the role that infection plays in the development of Alzheimer's disease.",9781476678610,Elaine A. Moore,156,,McFarland,241.5,RON,2020.0

Atlas of Pathologic Myopia,"This Atlas provides many beautiful images obtained with state-of-the-art technologies, including optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography, fundus autofluorescence, and wide-field fundus imaging, as well as traditional images and fluorescein/ICG angiograms. Gathered at the world’s largest High Myopia Clinic, the images are based on the long-term follow-up data of more than 6, 000 patients from Japan and abroad. Recent advances in imaging technologies have yielded many new observations and allowed us to detect new lesions, e. g. myopic traction maculopathy (or macular retinoschisis) and dome-shaped macula. An especially interesting aspect: the images obtained by ‘3D MRI of the eye’ and ‘ultra wide-field OCT’ to visualize staphylomas. These techniques were established by the editor’s group and make it possible to record the entire shapes of the eye, offering a scan width of up to 23 mm and scan depth of 5 mm. They have since been used to visualize posterior staphyloma, which was previously impossible to view because it spanned such a wide range of the eye. In addition, readers will learn what types of eye deformity occur in pathologic myopia and how they damage the macula/optic nerve. With this Atlas, readers will learn how to accurately diagnose each lesion of",978-981-15-4260-2,"Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko (Ed.)",203,,Springer Verlag,803.25,RON,2020.0

In the eight chapters (Cardiomyopathies, Myocarditis, Ischemic Heart Disease, Valvular Heart Diseases, Cardiac Masses, Pericardial Diseases, Congenital Heart Disease, and Miscellanea), the individual pathology is illustrated with a clinical case. The cases are divided into four sections: An introduction with a short medical history and the purpose of the diagnostic CMR A detailed CMR acquisition protocol CMR images, indicating purpose, method, analysis and meaning of the image, as well as videos. Concluding paragraph with the final diagnosis reached on the basis of the findings obtained in each image This book, collecting one hundred one clinical cases covering a broad spectrum of cardiac diseases, is an invaluable tool for radiologists and cardiologists.",978-3-030-41829-8,"Rustamova, Yasmin, Lombardi, Massimo",330,,Springer Verlag,661.5,RON,2020.0

It also serves as a primer for the Goodman oral board course, a bi-annual course sponsored by the AANS. The book begins by initially describing the format of the oral board exam. It then examines some of the concepts and techniques in the question-answer process that forms the major premise of the oral board exam. Each chapter contains 4-7 case presentations, which are organized similarly to how oral board questions are presented, with a brief history / physical and relevant imaging studies. The authors provide detailed analysis of these cases, as well as key references for each case with the salient conclusions from each referenced paper.

Neurobiology of Personality Disorders,"Personality disorders are highly prevalent and cause a substantial amount of human suffering and harm-not only to the individuals and families directly affected, but also to the population at large. These disorders generally have a heritability rate that is in excess of fifty percent, strongly suggesting that the behavioral disturbance they cause have a significant biomedical etiology. However, knowledge about the biological nature of personality disorders-and effective treatment of the latter-is significantly lacking. Although basic biological principles have overall served well in the foundation of psychiatry, they have received relatively little attention with regard to the areas of personality, temperament, and personality disorders. Neurobiology of Personality Disorders is the first book to focus specifically on the neurobiology of disturbed personality. It provides a thorough outline of the principles of neural science that mediate personality and describe what is currently known about how these biological processes are impaired in individuals with personality disorders. Its team of editors and authors are among the most frequently published and highly renowned international neuroscientists in the field of personality disorders, and its coverage of topics is comprehensive, authoritative, and heuristic.",9780199362318,"Dr Christian Schmahl, Dr K.

Albert and Jakobiec's Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology SET,"Keeping up to date with advances in comprehensive ophthalmology and in the ophthalmic sub-specialties is extremely difficult because of the accelerating rapidity with which new information and technology become available and the diminishing time and opportunity for practitioners and trainees to read and learn. The first edition of Albert and Jakobiec’s Principles and Practice (1994) was conceived with the idea of utilizing an electronic, updated version in which the chapters were revised by the chapter authors on an annual or semi-annual basis, but the technology was not sufficiently advanced to achieve this goal. Subsequent editions (2000 and 2008) were organized by Saunders and the last published by Elsevier (of which Springer has obtained the complete rights to move forward with the 4th edition, see attachment). For more than two decades, this text has provided its readers with authoritative and comprehensive coverage of all facets of ophthalmology, written and edited by a group of authors who represented a “Who’s Who” in ophthalmology. By using Springer’s Meteor platform, with its ability to allow authors and editors access to updating their chapters online annually/semi-annually, and with the recruitment of select chapter authors, this work’s usefulness as the standard text in ophthalmology will be",978-3-030-42635-4,"Albert, D.M., Miller, J., Azar, D., Young, L.H.

Clinical Insights and Examination Techniques in Ophthalmology,"This book elucidates the principles of sound clinical examination in ophthalmology. Based on the author’s extensive teaching experience, it makes the case for arriving at a diagnosis through detailed clinical examinations, including history taking, knowledge of clinical epidemiology, and using only the most relevant clinical tests. Starting with basic chapters on relevant statistics and clinical epidemiology, the book covers history-taking, visual function assessment, slit lamp examination, and examinations of each important field (e. g. the lids, orbit, cornea, iris and pupil, glaucoma patients, sclera, lens, posterior segment, pediatric patient and neuro-ophthalmology) in separate chapters. Full of practical tips on examining patients at the clinic, the book also describes the rationale behind each clinical test and its interpretation. It is also hoped that teachers who come across this book will evaluate students on the basis of these relevant clinical examinations rather than quizzing them on esoteric clinical tests that are not routinely used and are of little clinical value. This book is intended to help all ophthalmologists, beginners and veterans alike, improve their clinical examination thinking and skills.",978-981-15-2889-7,"Kuriakose, Thomas",241,,Springer Verlag,554.4,RON,2020.0
