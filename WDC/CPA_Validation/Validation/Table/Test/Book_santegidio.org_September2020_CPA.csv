The Sant'Egidio,"For all of its headline-making accomplishments for service to the poor and downtrodden, the Community of Sant'Egidio sees itself primarily as a group committed to prayer. The Sant'Egidio Book of Prayer brings the community's daily prayer to you, inviting you into its spiritual life of service and peacemaking.What is the constant spiritual source in your apostolic commitment? You sing of it often in paraphrasing the words of the Apostle Peter: \""We do not have riches, only the Word of the Lord.\"" This is your strength - your trust in the feeble weapons of faith: prayer, love, and friendship. In each of your lives, let prayer always accompany your service of mercy.Pope John Paul IISpeaking to the Community of Sant'Egidio in 1993I can recommend this volume heartily. It contains so many of the answers to the most vital questions of our lives, because it moves us all along the journey to that Word who is Life itself.Cardinal Theodore McCarrickArchbishop Emeritus of Washington",en,http://archive.santegidio.org/pageID/73/langID/fr/itemID/196/The-Sant-Egidio.html,"['Pri√®re', ""Sant'Egidio""]",2009-01-01,Andrea Riccardi,Ave Maria Press,The Sant'Egidio

Making Peace,"Nicknamed the 'UN of Trastevere', the Community of Sant'Egidio, which started life by coming together to pray in the church of Sant'Egidio in 1968, goes out from its Roman base to help resolve civil wars and international conflicts around the globe. Mozambique, Algeria, Kosovo, Liberia and Ivory Coast have all benefitted from its nonthreatening, but deeply committed presence. Sant'Egidio also works tirelessly to defeat AIDS in Africa and campaigns vigorously to bring an end to the death penalty. But Sant'Egidio's message is simple: a way to peace can always be found, and everyone, from professional diplomats to volunteers, from doctors to patients, can make a valid contribution to the peace process. This book presents the fascinating story of Sant'Egidio's activities for peace and reconciliation for the good of humanity. And their motivation: love of God and love of neighbor.",en,http://archive2.santegidio.org/pageID/73/langID/it/itemID/295/Making-Peace.html,"['Pace', ""Sant'Egidio""]",2013-01-01,Roberto Morozzo della Rocca,New City,Making Peace
