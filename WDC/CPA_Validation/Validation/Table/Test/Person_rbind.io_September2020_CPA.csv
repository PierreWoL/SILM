Quan Nguyen,,"Biography I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Educational Data Science at the School of Information, University of Michigan. My work focuses on analysing digital traces in educational settings to detect temporal discrepancies between course design and student engagement, and the subsequent effects on academic performance. My second research strand is to model peer interactions and peer influence on academic choices and performance. My research employed a wide range of statistical and computational techniques, such as multilevel modeling, network analysis, time-series/temporal analysis, and machine learning. My work has been published at top academic outlets such as Computers and Human Behaviors, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies and received multiple best paper awards at established conferences (e.g. LAK18 and HCI International 17).
