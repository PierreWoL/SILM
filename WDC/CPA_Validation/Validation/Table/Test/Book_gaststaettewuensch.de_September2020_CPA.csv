The addition of the line transgresses the conventional purity of the photographic picture plane and makes visible that which is invisible/theoretical/conceptual. This graphic intervention mirrors the way we superimpose a rational grid over the globe, mapping and regulating space and time to better coordinate and facilitate international trade and navigation.Although a prime meridian was established in the Greenwich Observatory in London in the late 18th century, many other countries used their own prime meridians, causing much confusion, and it was not until an International Meridian Conference in 1884 that it was agreed that Greenwich would become the global Prime Meridian.This cross-section portrait of a country also deals with the way in which time is measured, the Prime Meridian being the international dateline from which all other time zones",9783869307817,Simon Johnston,https://schema.org/OnlineOnly,18.28,https://schema.org/NewCondition,4.5,30.0,EUR

Pandoras Star,"The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport tunnels known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star ... vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him. Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship b7 ss mission for its own ends. Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been",9780345479211,Peter F. Hamilton,https://schema.org/OnlineOnly,17.34,https://schema.org/NewCondition,4.5,61.0,EUR

American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,"The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington foreverAndrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jacksons election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jacksons presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jacksons private world through years of storm and victory. One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder",9781400063253,Jon Meacham,https://schema.org/OnlineOnly,21.21,https://schema.org/NewCondition,4.4,88.0,EUR

Worship in the Presbyterian Church in Korea,"The Korean Protestant church has made an astonishing growth in the relatively short period for over a hundred years of mission history. No doubt, worship has made a major contribution to this increase. To what extent and in what sense can the worship of the Korean Presbyterian church be called Reformed? To what extent was it deformed or reformed? What kind of continuity or discontinuity has the Korean Presbyterian worship with the 16th century Geneva worship and with the historical development of Reformed worship? What would all these developments mean in terms of Reformed ethos of worship? The author tried to answer these questions through a study on history of worship in the Presbyterian Church in Korea. The answer the author found is that the Korean Presbyterian becomes more Korean by becoming more Reformed and more Reformed by becoming more Korean.",9783631364024,Seong-Won Park,https://schema.org/OnlineOnly,18.35,https://schema.org/NewCondition,4.6,30.0,EUR
