Golf Fore Kids,"Mesquite, NV, USA","Golf Fore Kids is a 4-person scramble golf tournament created to aid underprivileged children in the Virgin Valley, Moapa Valley, and Scenic/Beaver Dam/ Littlefield areas during the Holiday Season. Entry fees are a minimum of one (1) $50.00 toy per participant. Any and all other monies collected by the tournament committee will be donated to families in need. Toys will be distributed by the Salvation Army, Mesquite Fire Department, Mesquite Police Department, and local schools. Your participation and donations will be greatly appreciated by all the kids in our surrounding communities. Of all the wonderful charity golf events held in Mesquite, possibly one of the most anticipated is the annual Golf Fore Kids Tournament. Every year golfers assemble at four local courses and bring toys, bikes, balls, scooters, dolls and art supplies to donate to local children. Trailers are filled to the brim, Santa’s helpers work overtime, and because of the generosity of our local citizens, hundreds of kids will smile a little brighter this Christmas season. &nbsp; This year marks the 15th Annual Golf Fore Kids Event. As usual, Falcon Ridge, Palms, Canyons, and Conestoga golf courses have graciously donated their course for the day. Golfers will tee off",,Golf Fore Kids,5.0,,-114.06719,customer support,36.805531
