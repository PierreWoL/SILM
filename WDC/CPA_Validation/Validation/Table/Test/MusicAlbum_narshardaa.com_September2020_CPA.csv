SCHÖNESENDE — s/t DLP,NAR 060,2015.0,"Black Metal, Folk, Abstract Experimental Music","SCHÖNESENDE is the solo project of Matthew Bunkell, known for his work with LIGHT BEARER and MOMENTUM. With the exception of Jack Riddleston’s vocals on the song “Rise, Moloch”, spoken words by Joanne and Gary Bunkell and a the voice of postman-turned-poet Charles Bukowski and others, Matthew has written and recorded his debut album “Schönesende” all by himself. The endeavour, started in 2012, marks Matthew’s exploration of philosophical as well as psychological themes. Over the course of almost 70 minutes, “Schönesende” does not only musically explore different facets of Black Metal, Folk and abstract experimental music, but also immerses its listeners in a multi-disciplinary philosophical discourse revolving around questions about the human condition. Matthew, who in the near future intends to publish a collection of short stories and a novel which tie into the themes of the Schönesende project, cites authors such as Ernest Becker, Allen Ginsberg, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, John Fante and Bukowski as influences for his art. Becker’s work – in which the cultural anthropologist postulates that the denial of one’s death or mortality is a driving force for human behaviour of all types – resonated so profoundly with Matthew that he decided to explore this"

CATACOMBE “scintilla” LP,Catacombe,2019.0,"Post-Rock, Post-Metal","CATACOMBE “scintilla” LP vinyl (NAR 076) Before everything. Before computers, smartphones, wi-fi and social networks. Before satellites, planes, cars. Before the industrial revolution, the agricultural revolution. Even before the first societies. Let us travel back in time, before we even conceived the idea of time, before we met the sun and moon, day and night. And before fire. What do we find? The sparkle. The scintilla that human used to create fire. The first flash, and therefore, the first inspiration. In a way, “Scintilla” – the album – is Catacombe’s first. With its renewed sound – redefining post-rock with deeper harmonies and hypnotic, unpredictable rhythms – there are heartwarming breaches of light cutting through the massive walls of sound. There are echoes of suspending melodies, side by side with vigorous, evolving landscapes. There’s light and obscurity dwelling in deep resonance, inviting us to self-redefinition. It appears maybe too long after their last, “Quidam”, of 2014. It appears after individual and collective growth, after labour, after sleep, after laughter and tear. It appears when those who compose it are not the same as five years ago, even if the past feels near. And it arises, harshly, to teach us a valuable"

"['An Evil Light', 'ONE STARVING DAY — Atlas Coelestis DLP']",NAR 034,2009.0,Avantgarde Cosmic Doom Core,"The Italian avant/cosmic-doom/core band is back with another monstrous release. Although the band has always been rooted in its hardcore attitude, its sound has continuously evolved during these years and Atlas Coelestis is just the outcome of this process. Since the beginning of their decennial career, One Starving Day’s impact has always been definitely dark and claustrophobic, and their long suites alternate between hardcore/doom basic structures, cosmic openings, and deep and calm intimacy. Following the wide positive comments about their first album, Broken Wings Lead Arms to the Sun, the band has been described as a hybrid between Neurosis and GSYBE!. For this new release, called Atlas Coelestis, the band evolves towards a more personal song writing in order to design more particular musical landscapes. The album has been recorded and mixed by David Lenci at Red House Recordings and mastered at Chicago Mastering Service by Bob Weston. Atlas Coelestis sounds like a very particular mixture of sounds. Explosions of analogue synths, mystical patterns of harmonium and organ, fierce vocals full of anguish, delicate cellos patterns, eschatological tapes and samples, a solid rhythmic session, melodic and powerful guitars, they all characterize the complex sound of this album. The result is"

CODEIA “as he turned back towards the eye of the storm” 2xLP+CD,Codeia,2019.0,"Post-Rock, Post-Metal, Doom","CODEIA from Karlsruhe/Germany are back with a new record. There’s music for speakers, and then there’s music for headphones. While one propels you forward with sheer energy, the other embraces you with intimate moments. codeia’s as he turned back towards the eye of the storm manages both the powerful and quieter moments and wrangles them into a full-body experience for its audience. In comparison to their first record “don’t be afraid”, she whispered and disappeared, the new one as he turned back towards the eye of the storm feels more focused and determined than its predecessor. The band therefore likens their previous album to a prologue: “Our debut has introduced our characters, or influences. Now, the storyline unfolds and allows for a more complex character development.” Spherical sound patterns, hypnotic repetitions, and progressive structures set the stage for facet-like lyrics. Some things, however, shouldn’t change – the band once more has made it their mission to capture a live-feel on the album, making sure to record all guitar loops live. A vinyl-only bonus track of 22 minutes as well as two contributions by N (Denovali Records, Midira Records) lend additional richness to the production. Ultimately, the seamless transition between the"

As you may have noticed, the early days’ heavily Mid-90’s Screamo influenced sound, that helped YFERE to release on renowned labels APE MUST NOT KILL APE and DENOVALI, has evolved into a more specific, black metal-ish, gritty, dark and hyperactive hardcore noise. Thematically “Zirkel” (german for “cycle”) deals with the ubiquity of cycles which in the continuous mist of change, are opened, explored, closed and rediscovered constantly. The songs reflect on how cycles interweave and construct complex relationships, which dominate our thoughts and actions, how they self-reflexively enlarge and consolidate life, the mind, the world and our existence within and our view on it. The LP comes in a nice gatefold cover. All records including a download-code. Limited first pressing of 300 pieces! 100 of them are on limited 180-gram black vinyl.

ORTEGA — Sacred States DLP,NAR 066,2016.0,"Doom, Sludge, Noise","Since 2007, ORTEGA have been exploring the murky depths of humanity’s longing for the horizon. Perilous courses which drag carcasses ashore, sojourns that tell of the bells that chime on the sands below, collisions of doom, sludge and noise that tell tales of abyssal mankind. Now, “Sacred States” is the first glance upwards. But whereas the depths below are finite, the chasms above ridicule every human attempt to realise itself. Whether he looks above or inside, the void remains. The tentative grasps into the great unknown will never hold anything but pain, and ORTEGA recount every step into the understanding of this fate that we turn away from more often than not. The hollow is here. Recorded by John Bart van der Wal (Aborted/Herder) and mastered by James Plotkin. Featuring contributions by Gnaw Their Tongues and Ethan Lee McCarthy of Primitive Man fame.

RESPIRE — Gravity and Grace LP,NAR 067,2016.0,"Post-Hardcore, Screamo, Black Metal","RESPIRE is a six-piece band from Toronto, Canada, who combine epic post-hardcore, screamo, and black metal into a very cohesive formula that drips of maturity and patience. “Gravity and Grace” is their debut LP – a sprawling memoir of genre-defying soundscapes, reverb-washed tremolo harmonies, cascading arpeggios, dreamlike textures and walls of distorted guitars roaring over frantic rhythms, punctuated by tormented vocals and a near-orchestral array of instruments and contributors. Themes of loss, addiction, heartbreak, and existential anguish paint a bleak picture, but somewhere over the horizon rests a glimmering sense of hope, resolve and forgiveness. For fans of: Old Soul, Alaskan, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Neil on Impression and Fall Of Efrafa. This is a co-release between Zegema Beach Records (Canada), Ozona Records (USA), Dingleberry Records (Germany) and Narshardaa Records (Germany).
