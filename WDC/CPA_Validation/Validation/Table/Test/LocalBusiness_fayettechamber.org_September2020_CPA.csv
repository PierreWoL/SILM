He states, “ Too often the patient and the doctor both want the same thing, but there are huge beurocratic obstacles standing in the way.”. By establishing a membership based practice, many of those obstacles are instantly removed. Members are given direct access to their provider, even at night or on weekends. This provides piece of mind when an urgent question arises. In some cases, home visits can be provided when appropriate. With the smaller practice size, Dr. Adcox is able to spend a greater amount of time with each patient. This increased time allows him to become more than just a clinician, but also to be a teacher.
