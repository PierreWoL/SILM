The Crown in Crisis,"In December 1936, Britain faced a constitutional crisis that was the gravest threat to the institution of the monarchy since the execution of Charles I. The ruling monarch, Edward VIII, wished to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson and crown her as his Queen. His actions scandalised the establishment, who were desperate to avoid an international embarrassment at a time when war seemed imminent. That the King was rumoured to have Nazi sympathies only strengthened their determination that he should be forced off the throne, by any means necessary. An influential coalition formed against him, including the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, his private secretary Alec Hardinge, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the editor of the Times. Betrayal and paranoia were everywhere, as MI5 bugged his telephone and his courtiers turned against him. Edward seemed fated to give up Wallis and remain a reluctant ruler, or to abdicate his throne. Yet he had his own supporters, too, including Winston Churchill, the Machiavellian newspaper proprietor Lord Beaverbrook and his brilliant adviser Walter Monckton. They offered him the chance to remain on the throne and keep Wallis. But was the price they asked too high?

Through German Eyes,"The key battle of the First World War from the German point of view The Battle of the Somme has an enduring legacy, the image established by Alan Clark of ‘lions led by donkeys’: brave British soldiers sent to their deaths by incompetent generals. However, from the German point of view the battle was a disaster. Their own casualties were horrendous. The Germans did not hold the (modern) view that the British Army was useless. As Christopher Duffy reveals, they had great respect for the British forces and German reports shed a fascinating light on the volunteer army recruited by General Kitchener. The German view of the British Army has never been made public until now. Their typically diligent reports have lain undisturbed in obscure archives until unearthed by Christopher Duffy. The picture that emerges is a far cry from ‘Blackadder’: the Germans developed an increasing respect for the professionalism of the British Army. And the fact that every British soldier taken prisoner still believed Britain would win the war gave German intelligence teams their first indication that their Empire would go down to defeat.",Christopher Duffy,9781474618069.0,,2020-03-05,"['History', 'European History', 'Regional & National History', 'Humanities']",,https://www.welcometobookends.co.uk/titles/christopher-duffy/through-german-eyes/9781474618069/

Instructions Not Included,"Click. Whir. Buzz. Not so long ago, math problems had to be solved with pencil and paper, mail delivered by postman, and files were stored in paper folders and metal cabinets. But three women, Betty Snyder, Jean Jennings, and Kay McNulty knew there could be a better way. During World War II, people hoped ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), one of the earliest computers, could help with the war effort. With little guidance, no instructions, and barely any access to the machine itself, Betty, Jean, and Kay used mathematics, electrical engineering, logic, and common sense to command a computer as large as a room and create the modern world. The machine was like Betty, requiring outside-the-box thinking, like Jean, persistent and consistent, and like Kay, no mistakes, every answer perfect. Today computers are all around us, performing every conceivable task, thanks, in large part, to Betty, Jean, and Kay’s pioneering work. INSTRUCTIONS NOT INCLUDED is their story.

Soho,"Soho – illicit, glamorous, sordid, louche, poverty-stricken, squalid, exhilarating. One of Britain’s best-loved historians, Dan Cruickshank, grants us an intimacy with centuries of rich and varied history as he guides us around the Soho of the last five hundred years. We learn of its original aspirations towards respectability, how it became London’s bohemian quarter and why it was once home to its criminal underworld. The bars, clubs, theatres and their frequenters are described with detail that evokes the heart of the district. The history of Soho is written in its surviving architecture. Cruickshank points out the streets that were the stamping grounds of criminal dynasties and directs our attention towards the homes of renowned prostitutes, revealing Georgian sexual mores and surprising visitors – amongst them eighteenth-century painter Joshua Reynolds, whose peculiar ‘caprice’ was simply drawing the girls. Soho has been home to characters as diverse as Mrs Goadby’s girls to the Maltese mafia, and Cruikshank draws these threads together with kaleidoscopic verve. Even as he mourns some of the changes, he pays testament to the district’s resilience. He observes how the common denominator over the centuries is that it has always been a destination for immigrants: from French Huguenots to",Dan Cruickshank,9780297869337.0,,2019-11-14,"['History', 'British & Irish History', 'European History', 'Regional & National History', 'Humanities']",,https://www.welcometobookends.co.uk/titles/dan-cruickshank/soho/9780297869337/

Ladies in Waiting,"‘Provides a wealth of juicy anecdotal material about five centuries of court life’ New York Times ‘Naughty Knickers version of our island story’ Daily Mail ——————————————— Ladies in Waiting chronicles the lives of famous and infamous ladies who served royalty, casting a fresh, intimate angle on four hundred years of monarchy. For centuries, the most beautiful, able and aristocratic women in England competed for positions at court. Some who came to serve were remarkable for their learning and exemplary virtue, but others were notable for promiscuity and lack of scruple, drawn to court by a lust for money and power. Several ladies-in-waiting became royal mistresses, showing few qualms about betraying the queen consorts they ostensibly served. If bedding the King was not an option open to all, many ladies came to court in hope of finding husbands, only to succumb to constant assaults on their virtue or to find themselves denied permission by their sovereign to marry. Drawing on an enormous variety of sources, Anne Somerset provides an illuminating guide to the character, profligate or pious, of each court.

At work, they still get paid more than women for doing the same jobs. At home, they still shirk most of the unpaid labour. Putting the bins out does not count. Beneath the surface, it’s a different story. An alarming number of men end up anxious, exhausted, depressed – and very reluctant to admit they are. Even if they do everything that’s expected of them in work, life and fatherhood, genuine happiness is still elusive. By midlife, their levels of stress are higher and their levels of wellbeing are lower – and work-life balance turns out to be just a cruel illusion.

Belabored,"The U.S. has the worst rate of maternal deaths in the developed world, a rate that is increasing, even as infant mortality rates decrease. Meanwhile, the right-wing assault on reproductive rights and bodily autonomy has also escalated. We can already glimpse a reality where embryos and fetuses have more rights than the people gestating them, and even women who aren’t pregnant are seen first and foremost as potential incubators. In Belabored, journalist Lyz Lenz lays bare the misogynistic logic of U.S. cultural narratives about pregnancy, tracing them back to our murky, potent cultural soup of myths, from the religious to the historical. In the present she details, with her trademark blend of wit, snark, and raw intimacy, how sexist assumptions inform our expectations for pregnant people, whether we’re policing them, asking them to make sacrifices with dubious or disproven benefits, or putting them up on a pedestal in an “Earth mother” role. Throughout, she reflects on her own experiences of being seen as alternately a vessel or a goddess–but hardly ever as herself–while carrying each of her two children.

London 1945,"London at the outset of war in 1939 was the greatest city in the world, the heart of the British Empire. The defiant capital had always been Hitler’s prime target and 1945, the last year of the war, saw the final phase of the battle of London. The Civil Defence could not have succeeded without the spirit, courage, resilience and co-operation of the people. London 1945 describes how a great city coped in crisis, how morale was sustained, shelter provided, food and clothing rationed, and work and entertainment carried on. Then, as the joy of VE Day and VJ Day passed into memory, Londoners faced severe shortages and all the problems of post-war adjustment. Women lost the independence the war had lent them, husbands and wives had to learn to live together again, and children had a lot of catching up to do. The year of victory, 1945, represents an important chapter in London’s – and Britain’s – long history.",Maureen Waller,9781529338164.0,,2020-05-07,"['History', 'British & Irish History', 'European History', 'Regional & National History', 'Humanities']",,https://www.welcometobookends.co.uk/titles/maureen-waller-2/london-1945/9781529338164/
Unreasonable Success and How to Achieve It,"How do people of seemingly ordinary talent go on to achieve unexpected results? What can we learn from them? What are the ingredients for unreasonable success and how is it achieved? In this ground-breaking book, bestselling author Richard Koch charts a map of success, identifying the nine key attitudes and strategies can propel anyone to new heights of accomplishment. The pattern of success is fractal. It is endlessly varied but endlessly similar. Success does not require genius, consistency, all-round ability, a safe pair of hands or even basic competence. If it did, most of the people in this book would not have impacted the world as they did. Who could have predicted that Nelson Mandela, a once-obscure lawyer, could have averted disaster in South Africa, reconciling people of different heritages to each other and establishing a viable democracy? Or that Helena Rubinstein, a young woman growing up in the grotty ghetto of Kraków, could have changed the face of beauty throughout the world? Or that the illegitimate son of a notary would become one of the world’s greatest painters, known universally by his first name, Leonardo? Successful people typically don’t plan their success.

The Generals,"In December 1941, as the Japanese army led by Yamashita scythed through Malaya to capture Singapore, Britain’s defence of its Asian colonies collapsed. Poor preparation and inadequate leadership saw the British exposed to a new type of warfare in the Far East, a Japanese blitzkrieg that proved every bit as effective as Hitler’s in France the previous year. When the Japanese advanced into Burma and approached the gates of India and China, Churchill and his generals had little idea how to counter the seemingly unstoppable offensive. Defeat seemed inevitable. Yet only four years later, the Japanese army would be in full-scale retreat. A crushing victory would be achieved by Britain and her allies. From Malaya and Burma to India and China – across jungle, mountain and desert prairie – the Burma campaign proved the longest continuous campaign of the Second World War. In The Generals, highly acclaimed military historian Dr Robert Lyman examines the role of military leaders on both sides and analyses the roles they played in the desperate struggle that has become known as ‘The Forgotten War’.

Diet and exercise programs fail 97% of people in the long-term, resulting in short term weight loss, medium term regain, and long-term gain approximately 10 to 15% above starting weight. Scientists have known this reality for decades – the entire diet industry is based on it – yet we keep on falling for promises of fast, easy, permanent weight loss (and other fictional tales), putting ourselves through rebranded versions of the exact same thing … and expecting different results.

Context And Cognition,"While the general wisdom has it that behaviorism is dead, it not only survives but is intellectually active in areas such as psychological theory, the analysis of language and cognition, and behavioral economics. It is a successful, albeit limited, source of behavioral science. Its chief difficulty arises when its practitioners look out from their laboratory windows and attempt to explain the complexities of human behavior that will never be amenable to direct experimental investigation. Behavior analysis has failed to establish a methodology of interpretation to deal fully with such complexity. The message of this essay is that it cannot do so without embracing intentional explanation in the form of an interpretive overlay that plugs the gaps in its explanations of life beyond the lab.

Today it’s the busiest shipping lane in the world and hosts more than 30 million passenger crossings every year but this sliver of choppy brine, just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, represents much more than a conductor of goods and people.

We learn that Louis Bleriot was actually a terrible pilot, the tragic fate of the first successful Channel swimmer, and that if a man with a buttered head and pigs’ bladders attached to his trousers hadn’t fought off an attack by dogfish we might never have had a Channel Tunnel.

The Compassionate Mind Approach to Beating Overeating,"This self-help book explores the problems created by having ready access to high fat foods designed to taste good. Because we evolved in conditions of relative scarcity we have few natural food inhibitors and so most diet books try to encourage people to inhibit their eating by highly rule governed behaviours which have to be constantly worked at. However, this can lead to various forms of self-criticism which can undermine efforts at self-control. As a result our relationship with eating can be complex, multifaceted and problematic. Beating Overeating Using Compassion Focused Therapy uses Compassion Focused Therapy – a groundbreaking new therapeutic approach – to understand and work with our urges and passions for food. We can learn to enjoy and accept food and pay attention to our biological and emotional needs. This book is for people who have tried diets and found that they don’t work and will enable the reader to have a healthier and happier relationship with food and their body. Topics covered: The relationship between our brains and food, the evolutionary background to finding, conserving and eating food How too much or too little food affects the brain, why diets don’t work, factors affecting our eating behaviour",Kenneth Goss,9781849019019.0,,2011-01-27,"['Obesity: Treatment & Therapy', 'Other Branches Of Medicine', 'Medicine', 'Therapy & Therapeutics']",Robinson,https://www.welcometobookends.co.uk/titles/kenneth-goss/the-compassionate-mind-approach-to-beating-overeating/9781849019019/

Storm Birds,"“A pulse-quickening piece of fiction . . . A terrifying depiction of peril at sea” – Financial Times In February 1959, several Icelandic trawlers were caught in a storm off Newfoundland’s Grand Banks. What happened there is the inspiration for this novel. Not since The Perfect Storm has there been a book which captures the sheer drama and terror of a crisis at sea. Karason is an exceptional storyteller, an Icelandic Erskine Caldwell or William Faulkner. The side trawler Mafurinn is hit by a major storm just as they prepare to turn for home. Thirty-two men aboard, and a hold full of redfish. The sea is cold enough to kill a man in minutes, and the trawler quickly ices up in the biting frost and violent tempest. The heavy icing weighs down the already fully laden craft, which is pummelled by one breaker after another – and here, out on the open sea, there is no exit route. Distress signals from other ships in the same circumstance and be heard from the fishing grounds around them. It is a battle of life and death.

Squeeze Me,"‘Scabrous and unrelentingly hilarious . . . the Trump era is truly Carl Hiaasen’s moment’ WASHINGTON POST From the bestselling author of Bad Monkey and Razor Girl comes this hilarious new novel of social and political intrigue, set against the glittering backdrop of Florida’s gold coast. It’s the height of the Palm Beach charity ball season: for every good cause, there’s a reason for the local luminaries to eat (minimally), drink (maximally), and be seen. But when prominent high-society dowager Kiki Pew suddenly vanishes during a swanky gala, and is later found dead, panic and chaos erupt. Kiki was an ardent fan of the Winter White House resident just down the road, and a founding member of the POTUSSIES, a group of women dedicated to supporting their President – who immediately declares that Kiki was the victim of rampaging immigrant hordes. This, it turns out, is far from the truth. The truth might just lie in the middle of the highway, where a bizarre discovery brings the First Lady’s motorcade to a grinding halt.

The Little Book of Spiritual Bliss,"We live in a world of chronic stress and dis-ease, a world of rampant anxiety and depression. If we stay locked onto the horizontal plane of superficial concerns and challenges, we are doomed to feeling deeply unsettled. However, if we intentionally shift our awareness to the vertical plane of life — diving into spiritual depths and rising to transcendent perspectives — we connect with a Spirit that is both beyond and within us. Chapters Include: Ch. 1 Awaken Ch. 2 Connect Ch. 3 Wonder Ch. 4 Love Ch. 5 Trust Ch. 6 Home Each chapter offers five specific ‘sacred pause practices’ to instill a habit of first inviting stillness and then weaving a fabric of spiritual experiences.

But its crisp, clear water runs in her veins, and the notebook Amos left behind, filled with clues about a mysterious creature in the lake’s inky-blue depths, keeps calling her back. She never took Amos seriously when he was alive, but doesn’t she owe it to him to figure out, once and for all, if there’s really something out there? When she’s offered a Young Scientist position studying the lake for the summer, Addie accepts, yearning for the cool wind in her hair and that sparkle on the lake, despite her parent’s misgivings.

The Clerkenwell Affair,"In the spring of 1666 everyone’s first reaction to a sudden death at the palace of White Hall is that the plague has struck, but the killing of Thomas Chiffinch was by design, not disease. Chiffinch was holder of two influential posts – Keeper of the Closet and Keeper of the Jewels – and rival courtiers have made no secret of their wish to succeed to those offices. To Thomas Chaloner, ordered to undertake the investigation, such avarice gives a whole host of suspects an ample motive for murder. The same courtiers are at the heart of the royal entourage endorsing the King’s licentious and ribald way of life, and Chaloner has some sympathy with the atmosphere of outrage and disgust at such behaviour. London’s citizens, already irked by the wealthy fleeing to the country at the outbreak of the plague, have scant patience with the Court on its return. The city is abuzz with rumours of dissent and rebellion, fuelled by predictions from a soothsayer in Clerkenwell of a rain of fire destroying the capital on Good Friday. Chaloner initially dismisses such talk as nonsense, but as he uncovers ever more connections to Clerkenwell among his suspects, he begins",Susanna Gregory,9780751562729.0,,2020-08-06,"['Historical Mysteries', 'Crime & Mystery', 'Fiction & Related Items']",Sphere,https://www.welcometobookends.co.uk/titles/susanna-gregory/the-clerkenwell-affair/9780751562729/

In 1868, Charles Dickens dispatches his youngest child to Australia. Like his brother Alfred before him, sixteen-year-old Edward is expected to learn to apply himself in what his father considers to be the new land of opportunity. Posted to a remote sheep station in New South Wales, Edward discovers that Charles Dickens’ fame has reached even there, as has the gossip about his father’s scandalous liaison with an actress. Amid colonists, ex-convicts, local tribespeople and a handful of eligible young women, Edward strives to be his own man – and keep secret the fact that he’s read none of his father’s novels. Conjuring up a life of sheep-droving, horse-racing and cricket tournaments in a community riven with tensions and prejudice, the story of Edward’s adventures also affords an intimate portrait of Dickens’ himself.

"An Introduction to Coping with Post-Traumatic Stress, 2nd Edition","Traumatic stress arises in reaction to catastrophic life events. Such events can range from train disasters and car crashes to natural calamities such as earthquakes, wildfires and floods, and from life-threatening medical diagnoses to acts of violence and abuse. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common psychological condition resulting from such events and occurs when our coping resources have been completely overwhelmed. The intrusive hyper-reactions, recurring memories, flashbacks, avoidance behaviours and changes in the sense of self linger long past the actual event and often prevent a sense of healing or resolution with the experience. This self-help guide uses Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) strategies with a trauma focus to help you to manage your reactions to the traumatic experience and find new, effective ways of coping.

When You Know What I Know,"When you know what I know, you’ll wish you didn’t. It’s not the kind of thing you can talk about at school, or at the park, or anywhere, with a new friend or an old one, or even with your sister. (She’s too little.) But it’s everywhere once you know, once you can’t not know. In your face, under your eyelids. If you turn your back on it, there it is anyway. One day after school, in the basement on the couch, Tori’s uncle did something bad. Afterwards, Tori did the right thing and told her mom. But even if it was the brave thing to do, her mom still didn’t believe her at first. Her grandma still takes his side. And Tori doesn’t want anyone else–even her best friend–to know what happened. Over the course of the following year, Tori finds herself battling mixed emotions–anger, shame and sadness-as she deals with the trauma. But with the help of her mom, little sister Taylor, her best friend and others, Tori will find a way to have the last word.",Sonja K.

How Babies Sleep,"‘A clearly explained and reassuring guide from an expert in the field’ Publisher’s Weekly Discover the best baby sleep method – gentle, science-backed, and inspired by the latest Nobel Prize-winning research – that shows you how to get your baby to sleep through the night naturally. Sleep – or the lack of it – is one of the most crucial issues for new parents. Newborn babies typically wake every two to three hours, and there’s nothing bleary-eyed, exhausted parents want more than a night of uninterrupted sleep. But while there’s plenty of advice out there, there is nothing that’s based on the latest cutting-edge research about sleep – until now. In How Babies Sleep, Sofia Axelrod, PhD – neuroscientist, sleep consultant, and mother of two -introduces the first baby sleep method that is truly rooted in the science of sleep. After having her first child, Axelrod realized that the typical baby sleep advice conflicted with the actual science of sleep, inlcuding the findings from her mentor’s Nobel Prize-winning sleep lab. She developed her transformative method based on the latest discoveries about our body’s circadian clock and how it is disturbed by light and other external stimuli.

On Becoming a Person,"In this book one of America’s most distinguished psychologists describes his experiences in helping people to discover the path to personal growth through an understanding of their own limitations and potential. What is personal growth? Under what conditions is it possible? How can one person help another? What is creativity, and how can it be fostered? These are some of the issues raised, which challenge many concepts of traditional psychology. Contemporary psychology derives largely from the experimental laboratory, or from Freudian theory. It is preoccupied with minute aspects of animal and human behaviour, or with the mentally ill. But there are rebels, of whom the author counts himself as one, along with Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow and Rollo May, who feel that psychology and psychiatry should be aiming higher, and be more concerned with growth and potentiality in man. The interest of such a psychology is in the production of harmoniously mature individuals, given that we all have qualities and possibilities infinitely capable of development. Successful development makes us more flexible in relationships, more creative, and less open to suggestion and control. This book, philosophical and provocative, summarizes Dr Rogers’ experience. Non-technical in its language, it is not only for",Carl Rogers,9781780332857.0,,2011-08-04,"['Medicine', 'Psychotherapy', 'Other Branches Of Medicine', 'Clinical Psychology']",Robinson,https://www.welcometobookends.co.uk/titles/carl-rogers/on-becoming-a-person/9781780332857/

Hitler's Last Hostages,"The story of art is integral to the story of the rise of Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler, an artist himself, was obsessed with art–in particular, the aesthetic of a purified regime, scoured of “degenerate” influences that characterized Germany during the 1920s and 1930s. The Germany of Cabaret, hyperinflation, and Rosa Luxemburg was a society in turmoil, and among those who reveled in the discord were a generation of artists for whom art was a political weapon. They were fierce, inspired, and rebellious, but to Hitler, they were anathema. When they came to power in 1933, Hitler and Goebbels set their aesthetic vision into motion and removed degenerate art from German life: artists fled the country; museums were purged; and great works disappeared, only a fraction of which were rediscovered at the end of the Second World War. Most remained in garrets and cellars, the last hostages of the era of the Reich. In 2014, 1290 works by Chagall, Picasso, Matisse, Otto Dix, Max Beckmann and others were rediscovered.

A Terrible Thing to Waste,"A powerful indictment of the notion of hereditary intelligence, A Terrible Thing to Waste shows how environmental racism drives the black-white IQ gap and explains what can be done to remedy its toxic effects on marginalized communities. The 1994 publication of the The Bell Curve and its controversial thesis catapulted the topic of genetic racial differences in IQ to the forefront of renewed and heated debate. Now, in A Terrible Thing to Waste, award-winning science writer Harriet A. Washington adds her incisive analysis to the fray. She takes apart the spurious notion of intelligence as an inherited trait, pointing instead to environmental racism — a confluence of institutional factors that relegate marginalized communities to living and working near sites of toxic waste, pollution, and urban decay — as the prime cause of the reported black-white IQ gap. Investigating the deleterious heavy metals, neurotoxins, deficient prenatal care, bad nutrition, and pathogens as the main factors influencing intelligence, Washington explains why certain communities are so disproportionally affected and what can be done to remedy the problem. Featuring extensive scientific research and Washington’s sharp, lively reporting, A Terrible Thing to Waste is sure to outrage, transform the conversation and inspire debate.",Harriet A.

The City Under Siege,"1941, and Detective Inspector Stefan Gillespie is ferrying documents between Dublin and war-torn London. When Ireland’s greatest actor is arrested in Soho, after the brutal murder of a gay man, Stefan extricates him from an embarrassing situation. But suddenly he is looking at a series of murders, stretching across Britain and Ireland. The deaths were never investigated deeply as they were not considered a priority. And there are reasons to look away now. It’s not only that the killer may be a British soldier, Scotland Yard is also hiding the truth about the victim. But an identical murder in Malta makes investigation essential. Malta, at the heart of the Mediterranean war, is under siege by German and Italian bombers. Rumours that a British soldier murdered a Maltese teenager can’t go unchallenged without damaging loyalty to Britain. Now Britain will cooperate with Ireland to find the killer and Stefan is sent to Malta. The British believe the killer is an Irishman; that’s the result they want. And they’d like Stefan to give it to them. But in the dark streets of Valletta there are threats deadlier than German bombs… Praise for Michael Russell ‘Complex but compelling . . . utterly vivid",Michael Russell,9781472130396.0,,2020-07-02,"['Crime & Mystery', 'Fiction & Related Items']",Constable,https://www.welcometobookends.co.uk/titles/michael-russell/the-city-under-siege/9781472130396/
