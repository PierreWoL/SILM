The Bel Canto Pet,"THE ARTIST MANIPULATES HIS WORK. These two variant copies — an unaltered and an apparently uniquely-altered version — of the second of Joseph Cornell's rare artists books (the first was MARIA from the previous year) were produced by the artist at his own expense and privately distributed to friends. Both of Cornell's artists books from the mid 1950s are devoted to legendary nineteenth-century sopranos — 'Maria' to Maria Malibran and the present work to Giulia Grisi. Cornell expressed his fascination with these two operatic stars, whose work is lost irretrievably, except in eye-witness accounts such as the one reproduced here from the American author Nathaniel Parker Willis. 'The Bel Canto Pet' describes a dinner attended by Grisi, during which she imitated the song of her pet mockingbird, who in turn imitated the singers present. With a superb provenenance: These two variants were preserved in the collection of Cornell assistant Alexandra Anderson, who worked for the artist in 1964-65 (\""I worried because he never ate anything ... I would prepare him dinner but he wouldn't touch it ... He once told me I was too grown up,\"" quoted in Deborah Solomon, 'Utopia Parkway,' p. 308).

Celebrating Ferdinand III's (1199-1252) canonization by Pope Clement X, the work was commissioned by the Cathedral of Seville, and the text written by the poet, chronicler and translator Fernando de la Torre Farfán.

"Balet comique de la Royne, faict aux nopces de Monsieur le Duc de Ioyeuse & madamoyselle de Vaudemont sa soeur","FIRST EDITION. This famous early dramatic fusion of ballet, opera and poetry was commissioned by the Queen Consort of France, Louise de Lorraine (1553-1601), and was performed on 15 October 1581 as part of the festivities celebrating the marriage of her sister, Marguerite de Vaudémont (1564-1625), to Anne, Duc de Joyeuse (1561-1587), King Henri III's favorite. The Italian dancing-master Baltazarini, called Beaujoyeulx, conceived the production, Jacques Patin designed it; La Chesnaye, Salmon and Beaulieu composed the music and poetry. The novelty was manifested in the dancing – the dancers’ steps measured and performed in synchronicity with the accompanying music and verse consciously reflecting the rules of Jean-Antoine de Baïf's Académie de Poésie et de Musique. The publisher Patin was also responsible for the lavish illustrations, including a view of the spectators – among them the King and his mother, Catherine de' Medici – and the decorated sets in the hall, without proscenium or separate stage area. The plates further depict the elaborate chariots, most notably the fountain that carried the Queen; sirens, tritons, allegorical figures and other participants in the drama.

Hopper Drawing,"First edition. \""Edward Hopper (18821967) is recognized as one of the most well-known American artists of the 20th century. His distinctive style, combining subtle observations of the world with his imagination, has not only influenced other artists but also photographers, filmmakers, and popular culture. Although Hopper is primarily known for his oil paintings, including such iconic works as \""Nighthawks \""(1942) and \""Early Sunday Morning\"" (1930), this important publication is the first comprehensive exploration of his drawings and working methods. In 1967, Hopper s widow, Josephine Nivison Hopper, bequeathed her husband s artistic estate to the Whitney Museum of American Art, including a fascinating collection of more than 2,500 drawings spanning his entire career. This group of works has never been the subject of in-depth study and many have never been reproduced before. Hopper kept these drawings for personal reference as he revisited various themes throughout his career. Carter E. Foster examines how Hopper used his drawings to develop his paintings, arguing that the artist s work can only be fully understood aftercareful study of these preparatory sketches. Foster also argues that Hopper was, in many ways, a traditional draftsman who methodically developed schematic ideas into detailed studies to refine content.","['author', 'Carter E.

He had previously used ether with great benefit in midwifery, but now substituted chloroform, being the first to do so\"" (Garrison-Morton-Norman 5657). The paper appeared simultaneously in The Lancet (v. 2, 1847, p. 549). First announcements of surgical operations under general anesthesia appeared in October 1846. Since that announcement, Simpson began to search for substances as good as or better than the American ethyl ether. While rifling through papers on his desk, he found a vial of a colorless liquid sent to him by the German apothecary, Justus von Leibig. It was chloroform, and Simpson and his associates, Keith and Duncan, successfully utilized it. Simpson immediately recommended its use to alleviate pains in childbirth. He presented the results of his experiments with chloroform to the Medico-Chirurgical Sociery in Edinburgh on 10 November 1847; they published his scarce first report. This is his second report on chloroform. On page 906 in the volume is the preliminary announcement: \""Discovery of a substitute for ether vapour.\"" \""Chloroform's considerable advantages over sulphuric ether, enumerated by Simpson in his paper, caused it to rapidly displace ether as a","['Sir James Young SIMPSON', 'SIMPSON, Sir James Young (1811-1870)']",USD,"Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans,",InStock,800.0

Friends of the artist and the publisher alerted them to a story by Henry James from 1873 that employed the same figurine for different ironic purposes. Dine photographed his clay maquette and bronzes, and publisher Andrew Hoyem arranged eighteen of the pictures as a narrative sequence, in which the romance of the two animals movingly evokes the human condition. The philosopher and art critic Arthur Danto wrote an essay on the James story and the Dine works. The book and the album of intaglio prints are enclosed in a box displaying a sculpture specially created by Dine for this edition” (Arion Press).
