Life is so busy with work, school, and kids, that sometimes the repairs and upgrades around our homes get left for “someday when I can get to it.” Having someone you can depend on to repair and renovate when needed, to coordinate with other contractors if it’s a larger job, and to ensure that everything gets done right, so that you can spend your weekends enjoying your home instead of struggling to complete projects in your limited free time, makes your life easier. Or, if you’re a landlord who needs someone to manage the property’s repairs to ensure that your real estate stays valuable while you are off site, we can take on those projects for you as well. Give us a call for any need you have for your home, business, or rental properties. One call takes care of it all. #MorrisHomeServices",,01930,MA,Gloucester,7 Knowlton Square

The Village Restaurant of Essex,(978) 768-6400,Send Email,"About Us In 1956 Carl Carter and Armand Ricci (Carl's son-in-law) took a leap of faith and purchased a 15 seat burger joint known as ''Wimps''. With the help of their wives and vast support from their family, 63 years later the location has become a local favourite and north shore staple called Village Restaurant. Armand and Kathleen Ricci passed their passion for the Village to their children Kevin and Mark (also assisted by their wives Luanne and Diane) and after 60 years of service, passed the Village's caretaker honours to the Audette family in December of 2018. The Village, in all her glory, continues on with with the pride and passion from the new family and the community around it. Serving fresh, never frozen, local seafood and the best clams on the north shore will always be the structure of this beloved restaurant. Village Restaurant is more than just a place to eat: it's a home, it's an experience, and it's bones are made of love and passion for family, food, and community!",(978) 768-3545,01929,MA,Essex,55 Main Street

The Band was founded in 1932 as a volunteer (that means that no one gets paid) concert band and began its eighty-second year in 2015. We’ve played a Summer Concert series every July and August since our first appearances in 1933. Including summer players (returning students and summer visitors), we perform with about 40 players during the summer; we have about thirty-five during the winter months. Our membership ranges from advanced students to retired professionals. Among our forty or so members, we have nurses, teachers, students, real estate agents, whale watch guides, technicians, fishermen, engineers, and retired folks. Players have been members of the group for as long as fifty years, and as short a time as six months. This varied bunch meets almost every Thursday evening at the Legion Hall in Rockport, where we rehearse for two hours (and sometimes have pizza). Other than our Summer Series, we play for community events, nursing homes, a Veteran’s Day program in conjunction with the local American Legion Post, and two to three indoor concerts",,01966,MA,Rockport,32 Beach Street

It was a wonderful place to find like-minded folks who had a passion to end the scourge of cancer. It was here I discovered a literal army of amazing people fighting this war on cancer together. Team Scrawney-Morgan was born, as well as the Cape Ann Kids PMC and our Jimmy Fund Walk Team. All of which has helped us raise well over $190,000 since 2013. As we have grown, we decided to make our efforts a two-pronged plan. First raising unrestricted funds for Dana-Farber to help them with the astounding Cancer research they do each and every day. Second is partnering with former New England Patriot, Joe Andruzzi, whose Foundation's mission mirrors ours on a grander scale.

Lobster Trap Gifts,(978) 479-6907,Send Email,"About Us Sometimes I think I have salt water in my veins. I grew up as the only daughter in a family of commercial fishermen in Gloucester, Massachusetts, America’s oldest seaport also known as the “secret Cape.” My father and my five brothers ran a fleet of fishing boats. Home was a short hop from the docks, where I’d ride my bike to meet them on their return after ten days at sea. Two of my brothers still fish on their boat, the Captain Dominic, one of the few remaining commercial fishing boats in the Northeast. How does a former personal shopper turned full-time mom invent the original New England wine trap? One evening my husband, a hobby lobsterer, decided to craft a wall shelf using lobster trap wire. Bingo. If brightly colored wire could trap lobsters, why not a bottle of whiskey or wine, or cutlery and napkins, or hanging plants? And why not make it useful and decorative? The result was The Wine Trap (complete with patent and trademark), a colorful carrier with a lock and handle launched in 2015 and created from genuine lobster trap materials — plastic-coated wire, float rope, and bait bags.

Cogswell's Grant,(978) 768-3632,Send Email,"About Us A mecca for lovers of antiques and American folk art, Cogswell’s Grant was the summer home of renowned collectors Bertram K. and Nina Fletcher Little. The colonial-era farmhouse is a rich backdrop for their celebrated collection, assembled over nearly sixty years. Though known for their research, the Littles decorated with an eye for visual delight rather than historical accuracy. Their home is rich in atmosphere and full of strong, even quirky character. The Littles purchased this 165-acre property overlooking the Essex River in 1937 and carefully restored the 1728 farmhouse. Cogswell’s Grant was the perfect setting for the Littles’ antiques, but was also important as a working farm and family retreat where they relaxed and entertained. The rooms overflow with folk art portraits, painted furniture, redware, hooked rugs, weathervanes, and decoys. It is one of the only places where you can visit such a collection in the home for which it was assembled.",(978) 768-6274,01929,MA,Essex,60 Spring Street

Chloe Leigh Designs:Handcrafted Fine Jewelry,,Send Email,"About Us Growing up surrounded by the ocean landscape of Cape Ann, Chloe Leigh finds inspiration in her natural environment. Her inspiration stems from her love of the sea and its complex habitat of plants and flowers. She is drawn to circular forms, a warm palate, and hidden features that are often overlooked. Chloe creates memorable fine jewelry with a sophisticated and delicate style to compliment the wearer. Each piece is individually handcrafted and thoughtfully created by Chloe in her studio. She primarily works with argentium silver, tarnish resistant sterling silver, 18K gold, and precious gemstones; and uses traditional metalsmithing techniques such as hand fabrication, lost wax casting, forming, fusing, soldering, hammering and stone setting. Each piece is meticulously hand polished to a bright finish or hand-textured with her signature sparkling sand-like texture. She has a BFA in Jewelry and Metalsmithing from Massachusetts College of Art and Design and an AJP from GIA, the world's largest and most respected institute of gemological research. She also sought additional training by attending Alchimia Contemporary Jewelry School in Florence, Italy; Davide Penso Glass Jewels classes in Murano, Italy; Marchutz College of Art and Design in Aix-en-Provence, France; and The Glass Furnace in Istanbul,",,01930,MA,Gloucester,196 Main Street
