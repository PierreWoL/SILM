Leading With Obeya,"In 2014 when Tim Wiegel was introduced to the concept of Obeya, pieces of a puzzle started falling into place. The Obeya (Japanese for 'big room') is a physical space where visual management is used to align operational teams and leadership in their efforts to translate strategy into meaningful day-to-day work and results. Toyota started using Obeya during the development of the Prius in the 90's. Both the car itself and the way it was developed were a huge success from a project management perspective. A growing number of companies and teams are learning about the advantages of working with Obeya in industry, consumer goods, IT, finance, telcom, healthcare, government and ngo's. Using Obeya not just for a project, but to lead the organization itself is the answer to a much needed alignment between leadership and operational teams. It helps develop the ability to have meetings that create meaningful context and avoid distractions such as bias, ego and over-complexity. When used throughout the organization, it supports the development of a systematic approach to leadership that enables consistent, coherent and effective decision-making. In search for cause-and-effect under the umbrella of a committed purpose and clarity on strategic direction, the systems-thinking approach",http://schema.org/EBook,9789462763968,,2020-07-01,nl,Tim Wiegel,Boom uitgevers Amsterdam,

Psychological Communication (2nd edition),"This book combines relevant theoretical insights and concrete communication skills necessary for effective counselling and coaching. The authors first explore the helper&rsquo;s basic attitude. Secondly, they discuss views from client-centred, cognitive behavioural and social learning theories that are important for good helping. Bridging theory and practice they describe the helper in four roles: confidant, communicative detective, teacher, and coach. The helper uses these roles within a three stage helping model: problem clarification, gaining new insights and treatment of the problem. As a guide to counselling practice they describe the essential communications skills for each of these three stages. Many examples from practice clarify the counsellor-client interaction which is discussed, throughout the book. The recent online material (www.psychologicalcommunication.com), accompanying this book, offers numerous exercises that are helpful to enhance the student&rsquo;s insight in the theories and to acquire the communication skills. Adequate and inadequate use of these skills are demonstrated by different helpers, and the students have to evaluate their actions or have to apply the skills themselves. After that they receive expert feedback. Psychological Communication has proved to be of great value for many communication skill training programs in scientific and higher vocational education.

The 10x Growth Machine (English),"Innovate or die! How do you achieve long-term growth in a highly competitive business environment? Many established companies are facing a similar challenge. Sales from existing products is declining and the urgency to innovate the existing business and create new businesses is bigger than ever. Scale as a competitive advantage is no longer sufficient to compensate for the slow speed of corporate innovation. We need to leverage the organizations scale and assets and combine this with the speed entrepreneurs have in building businesses. Product innovation is in most companies a priority, but business model innovation is failing while it is considered as one of the most important drivers for revenue growth. Hackathons, accelerators and startup collaborations are the vehicles for innovation, but what is the impact of these initiatives? Does it lead to real business impact or is it fair to say that most innovation projects end up at the graveyard? How do you turn this around? My thesis is that innovation beyond the core business has zero change of survival in the current organization structures. These types of innovations need to be incubated in a different way, separate from the core business.

Management in Singularity (English edition),"Management in Singularity won the Silver Axiom Business Book Award 2018 in the category Business Technology. Management in Singularity is also published in Dutch. Are you ready for unprecedented acceleration in scientific and technological developments? Innovations and scientific breakthroughs tripping over each other. This is not only perception, it's a fact. Drivers of this acceleration can be found in the availability of super computers in new technologies like nanotechnology, 3 and 4D-printing, bionics and artificial intelligence. In order to prepare ourselves, we need to change the way we think: linear thinking is to be replaced by exponential thinking. The best answer to the question 'what's your plan?' is perhaps 'there is no plan, only adaptability to developing circumstances'. Humans will not be required anymore for the next software update. That point is called Singularity or Transcendence and is foreseen in 2035. Witnessing the current acceleration in technologic developments we are clearly on our way. One thing is for sure: singularity is nearer than you might think.

"Group dynamics, an introduction (English)","Group dynamics, which is the study of human behaviour in small groups, serves as a link between the two fields of psychology and sociology. The book, &lsquo;Group Dynamics: an introduction&rsquo;, provides the reader with a basic knowledge of the themes that pertain to this field and which have been developed over the past eighty years. There are four main themes that group dynamics touches upon: group development, leadership, the functioning of groups and group context. Each group represents a unique and particular blend of these four ingredients. It is in a certain stage of its development or in a transitional phase, it is subject to a given form of leadership, it communicates in a certain way and on a certain level, and it functions within a specific context. This book focuses on each of these four ingredients extensively. Several other themes are also discussed such as systems &amp; communication theory, feedback, decision-making and conformity. Over the past twenty years, this book has grown into a classic in the field of group dynamics in the Netherlands and in Belgium. It has attained a wide readership, which inclu&not;des professionals who work together with groups or who are training to do so, as",http://schema.org/Paperback,9789024403707,528,2015-11-03,nl,Jan Remmerswaal,Boom uitgevers Amsterdam,
