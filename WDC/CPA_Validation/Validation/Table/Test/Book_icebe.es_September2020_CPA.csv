DISEASED STATES. EPIDEMIC CONTROL IN BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES,"Outbreaks of Ebola, SARS, MERS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza are brutal reminders of the dangers of infectious disease. Comparing the development of disease control in Britain and the United States, from the 1793 yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia to the H1N1 panics of more recent times, Diseased States provides a blueprint for managing pandemics in the twenty-first century. To understand why these two nations have handled contemporary disease threats in such different ways, Charles Allan McCoy examines when and how disease control measures were adopted in each country from the nineteenth century onward, which medical theory of disease was dominant at the time, and where disease control was located within the state apparatus. Particular starting conditions put Britain and the United States on distinct trajectories of institutionalization that led to their respective systems of disease control. As McCoy shows, even the seemingly objective matter of contagion is deeply enmeshed in social and political realities, and by developing unique systems of biopower to control the spread of disease, Britain and the United States have established different approaches of exerting political control over citizens' lives and bodies.

SKULL BASE IMAGING. THE ESSENTIALS,"This book is a comprehensive guide to skull base imaging. Skull base is often a �no man�s land� that requires treatment using a team approach between neurosurgeons, head and neck surgeons, vascular interventionalists, radiotherapists, chemotherapists, and other professionals. Imaging of the skull base can be challenging because of its intricate anatomy and the broad breadth of presenting pathology. Although considerably complex, the anatomy is comparatively constant, while presenting pathologic entities may be encountered at myriad stages. Many of the pathologic processes that involve the skull base are rare, causing the average clinician to require help with their diagnosis and treatment. But, before any treatment can begin, these patients must come to imaging and receive the best test to establish the correct diagnosis and make important decisions regarding management and treatment.

GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC PROPHYLACTIC HEMOSTASIS BY INTRA-ARTERIAL BALLOON OCCLUSION,"This book offers a highly informative guide to interventional radiology such as arterial embolization and arterial balloon occlusion for the prevention of massive hemorrhage and management of cervical myomectomy and cesarean hysterectomy. Recently, catheter intervention for hemostasis in obstetric patients has been increasingly used. Before myomectomy of large cervical leiomyoma or cesarean hysterectomy for placenta percreta with expected massive hemorrhage, a balloon occlusion catheter is inserted into arteries. In cesarean hysterectomy operations, ligation of internal iliac artery is not always effective in hemostasis of uterine bleeding: the success rate is about 40 -60%. Uterine blood flow during pregnancy is much different from that in non-pregnant women because large numbers of complicated collateral arteries develop during pregnancy, especially in patients with placenta previa. If the internal iliac artery and hypogastric artery are ligated, peripheral blood flow is still maintained, which causes intraoperative problems. The authors argue that effective transcatheter balloon occlusion requires a detailed knowledge of blood flow in both pregnant and non-pregnant women. As such the book provides extensive, detailed anatomical figures and videos offer readers vivid insights into methods of intercepting the uterine blood supply and the surgical methods.

SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,"This book offers an overview of the latest advances in the epidemiological, pathophysiological, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of secondary hypertension, provided by a group of the most highly respected European experts in this field. It is common belief that secondary forms of hypertension are rare, although in 95% of patients the cause of high blood pressure is unknown � euphemistically referred to as �essential�. There is increasing evidence from epidemiological studies that the prevalence of secondary hypertension is much higher than previously thought, accounting for 20%-25% of all hypertensive patients. There are additional, very good reasons for identifying those patients with secondary hypertension: firstly, they are exposed to a greater risk of suffering major cardiovascular events than patients with essential hypertension who have the same blood pressure level, and for this reason require particular care. Secondly, these patients can be relieved of a lifetime of pharmacological therapy or, at least, have a chance to be treated with more specific and effective medications. A high degree of clinical skill is required to recognize the often vague and subtle symptoms and signs that characterize patients with secondary hypertension, and clinicians need to fully comprehend the mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance",978-3-030-45561-3,Julio 2020,"MORGANTI, A.; AGABITI, E.; MANTERO, F.","['209', '1', '22']",EUR,"128,44 €"

THE HEART OF THE BRAIN. THE HYPOTHALAMUS AND ITS HORMONES,"How hormonal signals in one small structure of the brain�the hypothalamus�govern our physiology and behavior. As human beings, we prefer to think of ourselves as reasonable. But how much of what we do is really governed by reason? In this book, Gareth Leng considers the extent to which one small structure of the neuroendocrine brain�the hypothalamus�influences what we do, how we love, and who we are. The hypothalamus contains a large variety of neurons. These communicate not only through neurotransmitters, but also through peptide signals that act as hormones within the brain. While neurotransmitter signals tend to be ephemeral and confined by anatomical connectivity, the hormone signals that hypothalamic neurons generate are potent, wide-reaching, and long-lasting. Leng explores the evolutionary origins of these remarkable neurons, and where the receptors for their hormone signals are found in the brain. By asking how the hypothalamic neurons and their receptors are regulated, he explores how the hypothalamus links our passions with our reason. The Heart of the Brain shows in an accessible way how this very small structure is very much at the heart of what makes us human.

HIGH RESOLUTION AND HIGH DEFINITION ANORECTAL MANOMETRY,"The book provides a comprehensive overview of high resolution and high definition anorectal manometry (HRAM/HDAM), showing the possible benefits of a wider use of these techniques in clinical practice, as well as their limitations. Although these techniques provide fresh insights into anorectal function and offer a new perspective on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of many defecation disturbances, there is a need to clarify whether their use has beneficial effects on clinical management compared to conventional manometry. There is still a considerable way to go to gain the clinical diffusion of esophageal HRM, which has become the gold standard in studying esophageal motility. Indeed, many gastroenterologists and surgeons are convinced that further studies are necessary in order to be able to recommend HRAM and HDAM over and above conventional anorectal manometry.

DOCTORS AND TORTURE. MEDICINE AT THE CROSSROADS,"This book brings into sharp relief the extent to which the medical profession has enabled or participated in actions that are at moral crossroads. Physical and psychological abuse and violations of medical codes have already been brought to light by concerned bioethicists responding to ethical lapses of the �war on terror.� This book goes to the next level by looking at three areas that also merit our attention and call us to speak out against abuses. These are (1) dehumanization (such as forced nudity, hooding, sensory deprivation, exploitation of phobias, waterboarding, and environmental manipulation), (2) non-consensual forced-feeding, and (3) solitary confinement.

THROMBOSIS AND HEMOSTASIS IN CANCER. (SOFTCOVER),"In this book, leaders in the field explore our current understanding of thrombosis and hemostasis in cancer and address key questions on the subject. Among the topics discussed are the mechanisms that cancers use to activate the coagulation system, and those by means of which an activated coagulation system can lead to more aggressive cancer growth. Clinical chapters examine the role of thrombosis prophylaxis and treatment, central line-associated thrombosis, and cancer-associated hemorrhage. Subsequent chapters deal with the management of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, anticoagulation in the presence of brain metastases, and other unique challenges in the interaction of thrombosis and hemostasis in cancer. It has been 150 years since Armand Trousseau first described the well-known association between cancer and an increased risk of thrombosis, which may be considered the first paraneoplastic syndrome ever identified.

LICENSING LAWS AND ANIMAL WELFARE. THE LEGAL PROTECTION OF WILD ANIMALS,"This book considers the efficacy of the common regulatory model of the licensing regime as a means of regulating animal use in England, with a particular focus on wild animals and the regime�s ability to ensure animal welfare needs are met. Using information gleaned from over 550 inspection reports relating to the period 2008 through 2019, obtained using FOI Act requests, the book analyses the extent to which animals used by these industries are protected by law.Tyson analyses the limitations present in the practical application of English legislation responsible for creating a number of relevant licensing regimes.The regimes discussed include: The Zoo Licensing Act 1981, the now repealed Welfare of Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses Regulations 2012, and the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) Regulations 2018, introduced under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.Exploring the weakness in the use of this type of regulatory model, Tyson proposes compelling recommendations for change in future policy development. Making an important contribution to the question of enforcement of animal welfare laws, this book provides useful and original insights into the implementation of licensing regimes, and will be of particular interest to scholars of animal welfare law, animal ethics, and critical animal studies.",978-3-030-50041-2,Noviembre 2020,"TYSON, E.","['245', '1', '7']",EUR,"74,10 €"
TILTED IMPLANTS. IMPLANT-PROSTHETIC REHABILITATION OF THE ATROPHIC PATIENT,"When presented with atrophic arches, clinicians often turn to invasive techniques such as bone grafting or maxillary sinus augmentation. However, using tilted implants instead can avoid these aggressive procedures, allowing the implant support to be moved posteriorly and for longer implants to be chosen. The implants can be loaded immediately to support a full-arch fixed prosthesis in multiple configurations, such as All-on-4, transsinus implants, zygomatic implants, or the authors' signature V-II-V technique. This book first presents the science and clinical evidence behind the various protocols using tilted implants, then proceeds to discuss patient evaluation, diagnostics, and planning before diving into the methods themselves. Procedures are discussed separately for each arch, highlighted by dozens of clinical cases representing a diverse range of initial situations. In addition to the surgical protocols, methods for fabricating provisional and definitive prostheses are laid out with each step illustrated and explained. This comprehensive volume truly covers everything a clinician needs to know to use tilted implants with great success for their patients. Author � Enrico Agliardi.

Instead of using disease to understand health, positive psychology studies the components of a good life and helps people not only avoid mental health problems but develop happiness.

"ENDOSCOPY IN EARLY GASTROINTESTINAL CANCERS, VOLUME 2: TREATMENT","Endoscopy in Early Gastrointestinal Cancers, Volume 2: Treatment covers the detailed information of the indications, techniques and perioperative management of endoscopic resection including endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract remained a major health issue worldwide, which is, however notoriously difficult to treat. Endoscopic resection for early neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract had been developed for more than 25 years. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a recently developed technique pioneer by Japanese endoscopists. The principle of ESD is to achieve a complete resection of gastrointestinal neoplasia limited to mucosa with adequate circumferential margins. This novel endoscopic technique not only allows the achievement of en-bloc resection for early GI cancers, it also conveys a significantly lower rate of local recurrence as compared to EMR for early gastric cancers. There is an urge for the knowledge in applying these novel technologies for the treatment of early GI neoplasia worldwide. This book on the endoscopic treatment of early GI neoplasia, containing lots of illustrations, artwork and numerous short video clips, serves as a bridge between the recent development in endoscopy and the knowledge of gastroenterologist, endoscopist and surgeons.

POPULATION DYNAMICS: ALGEBRAIC AND PROBABILISTIC APPROACH,"A population is a summation of all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding. The main mathematical problem for a given population is to carefully examine the evolution (time dependent dynamics) of the population. The mathematical methods used in the study of this problem are based on probability theory, stochastic processes, dynamical systems, nonlinear differential and difference equations, and (non-)associative algebras. A state of a population is a distribution of probabilities of the different types of organisms in every generation. Type partition is called differentiation (for example, sex differentiation which defines a bisexual population). This book systematically describes the recently developed theory of (bisexual) population, and mainly contains results obtained since 2010. The book presents algebraic and probabilistic approaches in the theory of population dynamics. It also includes several dynamical systems of biological models such as dynamics generated by Markov processes of cubic stochastic matrices; dynamics of sex-linked population; dynamical systems generated by a gonosomal evolution operator; dynamical system and an evolution algebra of mosquito population; and ocean ecosystems.

CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IN MENTAL DISORDERS. A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH,"This volume presents a comprehensive overview of childhood trauma, considering the psychopathological definition and its neurobiological implications as well as its impact on different psychiatric disorders. The focus on childhood trauma rather than that occurring in adulthood is important due to its general �neuro-psyco-socio� and its specific biological implications, since trauma during childhood impacts directly on neurodevelopment.It has been suggested that early life stress increases vulnerability to psychiatric disorders; however, the exact mechanisms of this association are not yet completely understood. Although childhood trauma could be considered too unspecific to be an important risk factor for individual psychiatric disorders since it seems to occur across the board, it impacts differently on different psychiatric disorders, and it can modulate their clinical expression. Therefore, the assessment of early trauma needs to be included in the clinical evaluation of patients with psychiatric disorders.The volume will be an invaluable tool for psychiatrists, helping them to select suitable pharmacological, psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative treatments.

MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS OF DEAFNESS,"?Genetic disorders are a common cause of congenital/early-onset sensorineural hearing loss. The identification of genes that are responsible for hearing loss is a breakthrough approach and has advanced our knowledge of the biology of hearing.Despite advances in the discovery of deafness genes, clinical application still presents problems because of the genetic heterogeneity of deafness. Genetic testing has become more important for highly accurate diagnosis, predicting the severity of hearing loss and associated abnormalities, selecting appropriate treatment options, preventing hearing loss, and better genetic counseling. In this book, the genes responsible for hearing loss will be reviewed, and a diagnostic strategy for mutation screening using a mutation/gene database based on the mutation spectrum of a corresponding population will be discussed. The simultaneous examination of the multiple deafness mutations by means of Invader assay followed by direct sequencing will enable us to detect deafness mutations in an efficient and practical manner for clinical use.

OVERTRAINING SYNDROME IN ATHLETES. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND NOVEL PERSPECTIVES,"This book discusses major changes in our understanding of the most prevalent non-orthopedic, sports-related condition � overtraining syndrome (OTS), arguing that it should be considered as the manifestation of burnout in athletes, rather than simply the result of excessive training.While the chronic adaptations of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems to exercise are well documented, those of the endocrine system are less well known, and adaptations of the hormonal ranges for athletes are yet to be determined. There is also a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, consistent assessment methods and biomarkers.This book offers a systematic review of the hormonal aspects of overtraining syndrome, and a comparison with sports-related syndromes triggered by chronic deprivation of different sorts, including the female athlete triad (and its derivative, RED-S) and burnout syndrome of the athlete (BSA). It demonstrates that these conditions, although studied separately from each other, may all be different manifestations of the same condition, leading to �maladaptive� (dysfunctional forced adaptations to a hostile environment) changes in response to chronic depletion of energy and mechanisms of repair, causing multiple dysfunctions.The author proposes that OTS/Paradoxical Deconditioning Syndrome (PDS), RED-S/TRIAD and BSA are parts of a same condition, or at least a group of similar conditions.",978-3-030-52627-6,Octubre 2020,"CADEGIANI, F.","['1', '333', '16']",EUR,"98,80 €"

DECOLONIZATION OF PSYCHIATRY IN JAMAICA. MADNIFICENT IRATIONS,"This book traces the historical postcolonial journey of four generations of Jamaican psychiatrists challenging the European colonial �civilizing mission� of psychiatric care. It details the process of deinstitutionizing patients with chronic mental illness using psychohistoriographic cultural therapy, by engaging them in creating sociodrama and poetry writing, not only to express and reverse the stigma contributing to their marginalized status, but also to reconnect them to a centuries-long history of oppression. The author thereby demonstrates that psychological decolonization requires a seminal understanding of the complex mental inter-relationship between slaves and slaveowners. Further, it is shown how the model analyzes the antipodal dialectic history of descendants of Africans enslaved in the New World by brutish British Imperialists suffering from the European psychosis of white supremacy. Drawing together a detailed description of the sociopoem Madnificent Irations, with an examination of Jamaica�s political and social history, and the author�s personal experience, this compelling work marks an important contribution to decolonial literature.

INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES IN VALUES-BASED MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE. CASE STUDIES AND COMMENTARIES,"This open access book offers essential information on values-based practice (VBP): the clinical skills involved, teamwork and person-centered care, links between values and evidence, and the importance of partnerships in shared decision-making. Different cultures have different values; for example, partnership in decision-making looks very different, from the highly individualized perspective of European and North American cultures to the collective and family-oriented perspectives common in South East Asia. In turn, African cultures offer yet another perspective, one that falls between these two extremes (called batho pele).The book will benefit everyone concerned with the practical challenges of delivering mental health services. Accordingly, all contributions are developed on the basis of case vignettes, and cover a range of situations in which values underlie tensions or uncertainties regarding how to proceed in clinical practice. Examples include the patient�s autonomy and best interest, the physician�s commitment to establishing high standards of clinical governance, clinical versus community best interest, institutional versus clinical interests, patients insisting on medically unsound but legal treatments etc. Thus far, VBP publications have mainly dealt with clinical scenarios involving individual values (of clinicians and patients).Our objective with this book is to develop a model of VBP that is culturally much broader in",978-3-030-47851-3,Octubre 2020,"STOYANOV, D.; FULFORD, B.; STANGHELLINI, G.; VAN STADEN, W.; WONG, M.","['1', '414']",EUR,"49,40 €"

NEW STRAIGHT WIRE. STRATEGIES AND MECHANICS FOR A PROGRAMMED APPROACH TO ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT,"This textbook seeks to simplify orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning, and therapy by introducing the New Straight Wire (NSW) method. Using simplified cephalometry and treatment mechanics, this technique uses a table to systematically calculate and plan the necessary tooth movements before treatment, following the same parameters for each and every patient regardless of malocclusion. With the NSW technique, the treatment plan starts small and then moves to a larger scale, first carefully assessing the dental arches and then moving outward and analyzing their position on the patient's face. The treatment is therefore \""verified\"" before beginning; the teeth can be placed in the planned positions to check that the resulting occlusion satisfies esthetic and functional goals for each individual patient. This approach rules out treatment plans that lead to good occlusion to the detriment of facial harmony. This book therefore teaches how to achieve Class I molar occlusion with proper overjet and facial esthetics every time, regardless of the pretreatment condition. It clarifies when surgery is indicated and when dental compensations and compromises may be made instead. While orthodontics has historically been a specialty based on action and reaction, this book seeks to shift orthodontics to a practice based on systematic movements",978-0-86715-824-3,Junio 2020,"PEDETTA, F.","['1', '160', '441']",EUR,"96,82 €"

COMPOSITE VENEERS. THE DIRECT-INDIRECT TECHNIQUE,"The direct-indirect technique for composite resin veneer fabrication brings together many of the distinct advantages of the direct and indirect techniques. A direct-indirect restoration is one in which the composite resin is sculpted directly on the tooth structure without previous adhesive preparation, light activated, removed from the tooth, heat tempered, finished and polished extraorally, and finally adhered indirectly in the mouth in a single appointment. The resulting restoration exhibits improved mechanical properties, excellent esthetics, and unrivaled marginal adaptation and polishing. One of the most significant advantages of this technique is the possibility to modulate the final color of the restoration with luting agents, allowing for minor modifications in the restoration hue, chroma, and value. Furthermore, the direct-indirect technique has a wide range of applications, including prepless contact lenses and veneers, veneers with preparation (discolored teeth), fragments, diastema closure, and noncarious cervical lesions, among others.

TISSUE-ENGINEERED VASCULAR GRAFTS,"CardioCardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of death in developed countries. Revascularization procedures such as coronary artery and peripheral bypass grafts, as well as access surgery represent a 2$ billion market yearly for the US alone. Despite intense research over many decades, no clinically suitable, shelf-ready, synthetic, vascular, small-caliber graft exists. There is therefore still a quest for such a clinical vascular prosthesis for surgical revascularization procedures and access surgery. Many approaches have been tried and are currently under investigation with promising results. These range from acellular and cell-based, stable or bio-degradable, synthetic scaffolds to biological or decellularized grafts, not forgetting self-assembly technologies for in vitro or in vivo VTE. All these approaches can be further enhanced by functionalization, e.g. with growth factors and drug elution.

THE CYTOSKELETON. DIVERSE ROLES IN A PLANT�S LIFE,"This book focuses on the plant cytoskeleton and its various cross-talks with other cellular components leading to its role in plant growth and development. It not only allows the geometric and signaling dimensions of cells, but is also very important in physiological processes. The book discusses the recent studies showing the role of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton interactions in cell-wall assembly and dynamics. The authors examine the role of both microtubules in the mechanics of plant cells, and actin filaments in the motility of chloroplasts. Based on recent advances in the study of the acto-myosin complex using high-resolution microscopy, they propose a new model for intracellular transport in plants. Exploring an almost-forgotten field of bioelectricity in the context of the cytoskeleton, the book highlights connections between the dynamic actin filaments and the bioelectricity of membranes and demonstrates that the plant cytoskeleton is involved in the distribution of plant hormones. Lastly, it addresses the role of endomembrane -cytoskeleton interactions to show the importance of the cytoskeleton in organelle morphogenesis and cellular functions. Studies in various plant models have shown how the actin filament and microtubules control and coordinate plant cell growth and development.

EMOTIONS AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN,"This book focuses on asymmetries in brain structure and their role in emotional functions (such as amygdala in emotional comprehension, the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex in the integration between cognition and emotion and in the control of emotional reactions, and the anterior insula in the experience of emotions). The idea of hemispheric asymmetries in emotional comprehension and expression was first proposed about a century after the first studies showing that the left hemisphere is dominant for language, but it quickly became very popular. Initial investigations considered the right and left hemispheres as single functional units, but in the last few years several researchers have focused attention on asymmetries in brain structures playing a critical role in specific components of emotional functions. Furthermore, interesting data have been obtained by studying emotional and behavioural disorders of patients with asymmetrical forms of frontal or temporal variants of fronto-temporal degeneration. Elaborating on these subjects requires, on the one hand, a consolidated understanding of how models concerning the relationships between emotions and hemispheric asymmetries evolved in time and, on the other hand, a sound interdisciplinary knowledge of psychology (nature, components and hierarchical organization of emotions) and neuroscience (neuroanatomy).

PSYCHOPATHOLOGY IN WOMEN. INCORPORATING GENDER PERSPECTIVE INTO DESCRIPTIVE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. 2ND EDITION. (SOFTCOVER),"This book examines sex and gender differences in the causes and expression of medical conditions, including mental health disorders.Sex differences are variations attributable to individual reproductive organs and the XX or XY chromosomal complement. Gender differences are variations that result from biological sex as well as individual self-representation which include psychological, behavioural, and social consequences of an individual�s perceived gender. Gender is still a neglected field in psychopathology, and gender differences is often incorrectly used as a synonym of sex differences. A reconsideration of the definition of gender, as the term that subsumes masculinity and femininity, could shed some light on this misperception and could have an effect in the study of health and disease. This second edition of Psychopathology clarifies the anthropological, cultural and social aspects of gender and their impact on mental health disorders. It focuses on gender perspective as a paradigm not only in psychopathology but also in mental health disorders. As such it promotes open mindedness in the definition and perception of symptoms, as well as assumptions about those symptoms, and raises awareness of mental health.
