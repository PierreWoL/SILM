Sons and Lovers,"D.H. Lavvrence (11 September 1885 - 2 March 1930) was an English author, poet, playvvright, essayist and literary critic. His collected vvorks represent an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation. İn them, Lawrence confronts issues relat-ing to emotional health and vitality, spontaneity, human sexuality and instlnct. Lawrence`s opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official perse-cution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of vvhich he spent in a voluntary exile he called his \""savage pilgrimage\"". At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents. E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as, \""The greatest imaginative novelist of our generation\"". Later, the influential Cam-bridge critic F.R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness, placing much of Lavvrence`s fiction within the canonical \""great tradition\"" of the English novel. Lavvrence is now valued by many as a visionary thinker and significant representative of modernism in English literatüre, although feminists have a mixed opinion to the attitudes toward women and sexuality found in his works.",2012,501.0,David Herbert Lawrence,Dejavu Publishing,10.5,9786055469092.0,1.0,5.0,TRY

Hard Times (Collins Classics),"HarperCollins is proud to present its incredible range of best-loved, essential classics. 'It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage.' Set in fictitious Coketown, England during the Industrial Revolution of the 1850s, Dickens wished to expose the enormous gulf between the rich and poor through his writing. In Hard Times, the social and moral purpose of his work is at its most evident. Openly ironic and satirical in its tone, Dickens suggests a mechanization of society, where the wealthy are ruthless and uncharitable towards those less fortunate than themselves. Siblings Louisa and Tom Gradgrind are raised by their father, a harsh and pragmatic educator and his influence means that they go on to lead lives that are lacking in all areas. Louisa marries the arrogant and greedy Josiah Bounderby, ending in an unhappy pairing and the unfeeling and villainous Tom robs his own brother-in-law's bank.

"O Ergatis, 1908-1909: Ottomanism, National Economy and Modernization in the Ottoman Empire","Ergatis is a Greek-language newspaper published in Izmir from August 1908 until April 1909. Through the study of this newspaper, this book tries to shed light on certain aspects of the ideological developments that took place in the Ottoman Empire during the first months of the Second Constitutional Period, giving one example of one of the possible handicaps of Ottoman modernization.It would seem that at least a part of Izmirs Greek-orthodox bourgeoisie to which the publishers of Ergatis belong rally around goals that are not very different from the goals pursued by the Young Turks: uniting all Ottomans around a notion of Ottomanism, modernizing the Ottoman Empire and constructing an Ottoman national economy. However, their inability or unwillingness to sever their ties with their communitys traditional leadership and ideology, places severe constraints upon their modernizing discourse.",,122.0,Ileana Moroni,Libra Yayınları,120.0,9786054326242.0,1.0,5.0,TRY
Rakı: The Spirit of Turkey,"In Search of the Spirit of Turkey Rakı: The Spirit of Turkey At the mention of Turkey, many things come to mind. The meeting of Europe and Asia, and of the cold north winds with the warm breezes of the Mediterra-nean; a vast, rugged landscape. To be in this country is to look at the world from the center of world history; a place where cultures, languages and faiths blend, and nothing remains the same for long. Rakı is the traditional drink of this country, and as such, reflects the fundamental aspects of its personality. Though it's as clear as water, it turns white when water is added, and with a little ice, it envelops you in the heady scent of anise. What better evidence that nothing in this country is as it appears? And in the bottle rakı may appear rather innocuous but once you drink it...! Made from distilled grapes and anise, rakı, with its nearly 500 years of history, is the central element in a unique cuisine that has grown up around it. When introduced to a conversation between a group of friends, it deepens the sincerity and friendship, making it as indispensable a lubricant for everyday",2012,206.0,Erdir Zat,Overteam Yayınları,41.16,9786054588053.0,1.0,5.0,TRY

From Balat to Bat Yam: Memoirs of a Turkish Jew,"Eli Shaul (1916-2004) was a Turkish Jew. After spending his childhood in the colorful Balat neighborhood, he received a superb education at the prestigious İstanbul Erkek Lisesi (Istanbul Mens High School), the University of Istanbul, and the Reserve Officers Training School in Ankara. While still in high school, he began keeping a diary, which he continued during his college years and the time he spent serving as an army dentist in eastern Turkey. Those diaries, contained in this book, provide rare insights into what life was like for minoritiesand particularly for Jewsin Turkey during the nineteen thirties and forties. Atatürks Republic, which most of them ardently supported, had raised their hopes of at last being accepted as fully equal Turkish citizens in every way, but those hopes were cruelly dashed when discrimination and anti-Semitism continued, and even worsened, especially after Atatürks death in 1938. Not surprisingly, most of Turkeys Jews immigrated to Israel after it won its independence in 1948. That exodus provoked harsh criticism of the Jews in the Turkish press, and the Turkish Jews founded their own newspapers and magazines to respond to those attacks. Shaul was one of the first contributors to Turkeys fledgling Jewish press, and",,243.0,Eli Shaul,Libra Yayınları,170.0,9786054326532.0,1.0,5.0,TRY

Murder in Salonika,"It all happened in 1876, during the Year of the Three Sultans when a Bulgarian girl named Stephana made a journey to Salonika to convert to Islam and was subsequently abducted by a group of Christians. This event stoked tensions, and stirred outrage within the Muslim community. Public protests ensued, culminating in the murder of the French and German consuls by a Muslim mob on May 6, 1876. This Salonika Incident would consequently trigger a wave of hysteria throughout the West and among the Christian populations of the Ottoman Empire. There was fear of an impending massacre of the Christians which would never take place. A diplomatic war of words between the Sublime Porte and the Great Powers, which held the former accountable for this double crime, directly followed the incident. Through a detailed and meticulous account of this neglected episode of Ottoman-Balkan history, this book aims to cast light on an often distorted and highly misunderstood event which is a manifestation of Western attitudes toward the Ottoman Empire during the climactic years of the Eastern Question.",,136.0,Berke Torunoğlu,Libra Yayınları,125.0,9786054326525.0,1.0,5.0,TRY

Rumi and Christ,"Rumi's love is above all feelings, forms and fears. It is universal and, therefore, it teaches us to love every creation because of the Creator. It doesn't matter if you are a Christian or Muslim but if you love God truly and his creations, you are above all religions and faiths. Common people recite the Holy names of God, but this has no effect since they foster no love for Him. Whatever Christ did in the name of God was resulted (born) by the Power of His name. When the spirit joins God, to speak of that spirit, is to speak of God; and to speak of God is to speak of the spirit (they become one and the same). -Mesnevi V / 4039-4041- Rumi The book gives almost all important verses or words Rumi said about Jesus and a remarkable idea about how the Muslims and Christians got mixed up in Anatolia at the time of the Seljukian Empire after the wars between the Crusaders and Muslims had ended. Rumi has chosen Christ on purpose because he was a good example of perseverance, tolerance and sobriety.

They may be recognized by the way in which they spin out their thoughts to the greatest possible length; then, too, by the very nature of their thoughts, which are only half-true, perverse, forced, vacillating; again, by the aversion they generally show to saying anything straight out, so that they may seem other than they are. Hence their writing is deficient in clearness and definiteness, and it is not long before they betray that their only object in writing at all is to cover paper. This sometimes happens with the best authors; now and then, for example, with Lessing in his Dramaturgie, and even in many of Jean Paul's romances.

Turkey Between Democracy and Militarism,"This book discusses various aspects of the \""grand struggle\"" between bureaucratic / authoritarian center and democratic periphery. Issues such as nationalism, secularism, Islamism, militarism and Kemalism are dealtwith as well as the Kurdish question, political parties, the EU membership process and relations with the USA. Though covering a wide time span and array of issues, the articles share a common stand: they seek to develop a \""post-Kemalist\"" reading of contemporary Turkish politics. In its entirety this book provides the reader with an altemative perpective on the \""current history of Turkkey\"", and raises the following issues and questions: Is Kemalism compatible with democracy? How to explain anti - Westemism of the neo -Kemalists? Is secularism or democracy under threat? The AK Party: Islamist or democrat? The CHP: Social democrat or authoritarian? Can Turkey bridge Europe and Islam via EU Membership?",,1.0,İhsan Dağı,Orion Kitabevi,17.89,9789944769198.0,1.0,5.0,TRY
