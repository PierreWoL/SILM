Over the years, we have expanded our client base to include industrial and commercial clients. Throughout this time and listening to our clients’ needs our company’s growth has been fueled by our single-minded focus on the interests of our clients. In 2017 we transitioned from Rocor Beverages to Rocor Industries, by the name change, we have expanded our product line to not only include a complete beverage line of soda and juices, but to now include a complete chemical, cleaning, floor and paper products line, all while maintaining the outstanding reputation we have had for over 6 years. In December 2017, we purchased DP Industrial, one of Central Illinois leading companies in chemical solutions, floor finishing equipment and supplies. With this merger it allows us to not only expand our product line but afford us purchasing power to decrease our pricing dramatically.

Established shortly after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the company was originally run by the Koch family and was involved in numerous businesses including beer, spirits, candy, and office supplies. Many of these interests were sold off over time as the beer business began to excel again. Walter F. (Budd) Jacob began his career at Anheuser-Busch in 1952 where he worked in a number of positions. He started out loading boxcars, worked in the warehouse, and was promoted through the company until becoming District Manager. The Jacob family would eventually relocate to Peoria from the Chicago area in 1968. Budd left Anheuser-Busch to buy into Brewers in 1974. In 1978, he purchased the remaining shares from his partner and became the sole owner. Budd was the definition of a tried-and-true “Bud Man” and was very involved in the company until his passing in 2014. His family, and the Brew Crew, are continuing to run Brewers Distributing in honor of Budd’s legacy. Today our portfolio includes national beer brands like Budweiser, Bud Light, and Michelob Ultra as well as distinguished craft breweries such as Goose Island and",61615,(309) 692-5703,2421 W.

Starting with only one book and one bag of balloons, the first couple of months were quite entertaining, as the same dozen or so balloon animals were made over, and over, and over. Both family and friends were tired of dogs and such, and encouraged more creations, which led to more creativity, to keep them satisfied. More books and different balloon creations led to satisfied customers and opened more doors. Not long after, family and friends grew to include more and more folks wanting balloon creations, and thus, the business expanded to include private parties, small events, and private picnics. Word of mouth from these events quickly resulted in even more work at trade shows, festival events, church functions, restaurants, and much more! Yet even as the business ''ballooned'', the focus remained the same - To bring happiness and smiles to people of all ages through unusual and unique balloon creations. Thus the name----The Unique Twist! After many successful '' Kids Festivals'', The Unique Twist expanded again to take on new clients, new events: including",61604,,3002 N. Mission Rd,Peoria,IL
,(309) 686-3000,,"About Us The Journal Star is owned by Peoria Journal Star Inc. which is owned by GateHouse Media, a publicly-traded company based in New York outside Rochester. The newspaper marked its 150th anniversary in 2005. The bulk of those first 150 years were covered by Bill Adams, Peoria's ''Mr. History''. The newspaper's employee-owners voted in July 1996 to dissolve the stock ownership plan and sell all the stock of Peoria Journal Star Inc. to The Copley Press Inc., of LaJolla, Calif. At the time, the stock ownership plan was so successful that employees were retiring years ahead of actuarial projections. Each time, the company had to borrow money to buy back the stock of the departing employees, putting a greater debt load onto the company. The only way out was to sell the company. Copley was a family-owned group launched from Aurora, Ill., in the 1920s. The Peoria-Galesburg purchase took it to eight daily newspapers in Illinois. But a few years later, Copley sold the so-called Fox Valley group of dailies in suburban Chicago, Joliet, Aurora, Elgin and Waukegan, leaving just its downstate dailies in Peoria, Galesburg, Springfield and Lincoln.

The Spirit of Peoria was designed by architect Alan Bates, and built in 1988 at the Walker Boat Yard in Paducah, Kentucky, making it the first paddleboat vessel to ever be built there. The propulsion system was designed by Norm Rittenhouse, with steering by Custom Hydraulics. The Spirit has no props or thrusters, and is powered by twin Caterpillar 3412 diesel gensets, producing 700 kilowatts combined in 208 volt 3-phase voltage. The power is rectified using railroad-style rectifiers, probably from a GM GP38. The DC voltage goes to two traction engines, also from a GM locomotive, which drive the paddlewheel via two forty-foot-long by one-foot-wide chains.
