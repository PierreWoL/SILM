Low-Level Radiation and Immune System Damage: An Atomic Era Legacy,"Atomic weapons and nuclear power plants: they promised to ensure world peace and provide efficient energy to Americans during the 1940s and 1950s. Meanwhile, the post war prosperity led to the most dramatic population explosion ever witnessed in the United States: the \""baby boomer\"" generation.Times and politics may change, but many baby boomers-as well as their descendants-now live with an unforeseen result of the nuclear age. Rates of immune-related diseases have risen steadily throughout the past few decades, from allergies to cancer. While advances in medical care have kept death rates relatively low, the increased prevalence of certain diseases cannot be ignored.Low Level Radiation and Immune System Damage: An Atomic Era Legacy establishes an undeniable connection between the nuclear build up of the past and the widespread health problems seen today. While baby boomers were growing up in the 40s and 50s, above-ground atomic bomb tests and start ups of civilian nuclear power plants were carried out without fear of public exposure to radioactive emissions.Although the consequences of low-level radiation are still hotly debated, Mangano's research findings emphasize a direct link between nuclear exposure and immune system deficiency.

Nuclear Realism: Global Political Thought During the thermonuclear revolution,"What is a realist response to nuclear weapons? This book is animated by the idea that contemporary attempts to confront the challenge of nuclear weapons and other global security problems would benefit from richer historical foundations. Returning to the decade of deep, thermonuclear anxiety inaugurated in the early 1950s, the authors focus on four creative intellectuals – Günther Anders, John H. Herz, Lewis Mumford and Bertrand Russell – whose work they reclaim under the label of ‘nuclear realism’. This book brings out an important, oppositional and resolutely global strand of political thought that combines realist insights about nuclear weapons with radical proposals for social and political transformation as the only escape from a profoundly endangered planet. Nuclear Realism is a highly original and provocative study that will be of great use to advanced undergraduates, graduates and scholars of political theory, International Relations and Cold War history.",London,9781138477636,-,2016.0,"xviii, 175p.:illus,23cm",English,-,Nuclear Realism,-,-
