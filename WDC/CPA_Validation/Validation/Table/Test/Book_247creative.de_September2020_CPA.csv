The World As Will and Idea,"The Philosophy of Law is one of Kants latest works, and is so poor that, although I entirely disagree with it, I think a polemic against it is superfluous, since of its own weakness it must die a natural death, just as if it were not the work of this great man, but the production of an ordinary mortal. Therefore, as regards the Philosophy of Law, I give up the negative mode of procedure and refer to the positive, that is, to the short outline of it given in the fourth book. Just one or two general remarks on pg 151Kants Philosophy of Law may be made here. The errors which I have condemned in considering the Critique of Pure Reason, as clinging to Kant throughout, appear in the Philosophy of Law in such excess that one often believes he is reading a satirical parody of the Kantian style, or at least that he is listening to a Kantian",9786051809311,https://schema.org/NewCondition,Arthur Schopenhauer,https://schema.org/OnlineOnly,22.56,4.4,74.0,EUR

From the Ruins of Empire,"Pankaj Mishras provocative account of how China, India and the Muslim World are remaking the world in their own image - shortlisted for the Orwell Prize 2013SHORTLISTED FOR THE ORWELL PRIZE 2013Viewed in the West as a time of self-confident progress, the Victorian period was experienced by Asians as a catastrophe. As the British gunned down the last heirs to the Mughal Empire or burned down the Summer Palace in Beijing, it was clear that for Asia to recover a new way of thinking was needed. Pankaj Mishra re-tells the history of the past two centuries, showing how a remarkable, disparate group of thinkers, journalists, radicals and charismatics emerged from the ruins of empire to create an unstoppable Asian renaissance, one whose ideas lie behind everything from the Chinese Communist Party to the Muslim Brotherhood, and have made our world what it is today.Reviews:Arrestingly original ... this penetrating and disquieting book should be on the reading list of anybody who wants to understand where we are today John Gray, IndependentA riveting account that makes new and illuminating connections ... deeply entertaining and deeply humane Hisham MatarFascinating ... a rich and genuinely thought-provoking book Noel Malcolm, Sunday TelegraphProvocative, shaming and convincing",9780241954669,https://schema.org/NewCondition,Pankaj Mishra,https://schema.org/OnlineOnly,8.53,4.5,53.0,EUR

Tagging along is his diminutive squire, a boy called Egg—whose true name is hidden from all he and Dunk encounter. Though more improbable heroes may not be found in all of Westeros, great destinies lay ahead for these two . . . as do powerful foes, royal intrigue, and outrageous exploits.Featuring more than 160 all-new illustrations by Gary Gianni,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a must-have collection that proves chivalry isn’t dead—yet.Praise for A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms“Readers who",9780345533487,https://schema.org/NewCondition,George R.
