The Conspirators,"Draft script for an unproduced film. Copy belonging to Kimberly Ryan, with her name and phone number on the title page in holograph pencil and ink. With a few annotations in holograph pencil. An unproduced film adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 1911 novel \""Under Western Eyes,\"" which many consider to be Conrad's response to Dostoyevsky's \""Crime and Punishment,\"" whom Conrad detested. Conrad's father was a revolutionary imprisoned by the Russians which initially inspired both this book and Conrad's hatred of the authorities of the Russian empire. The story generally deals with the failed attempts of a revolutionary, told through a teacher of languages living in Geneva, as the narrator. A young revolutionary Razumov feels isolated within the Czarist system and cynical about his station in life but falls into a trap of unfairness through simply associating with actual revolutionaries, which land him in trouble and inspire others to take a stand against the government. Razumov betrayed a fellow revolutionary by ratting him out to the police, and then working with the police as a double agent. When his conscience gets the better of him and he confesses his misdeeds to a revolutionary gathering in Switzerland, they destroy his eardrums.

Executed on Ms. Nemtchinova's personal stationery, with the address of her Ballet School at the Hotel Ansonia on 73rd and Broadway in New York. In the letter, Nemtchinova thanks Selznick for a poster she received as a gift from him, saying that her studio is about to be repainted and that she is going to find a \""good place\"" for it. Miss Nemtchinova's most famous role was that of the androgynous ''Girl in Blue'' in ''Les Biches,'' Bronislava Nijinska's 1924 ballet about the sexual and social mores of the chic set in France. It was in such experimental ballets, including the 1930 ''Aubade,'' which the young George Balanchine created for Miss Nemtchinova's own company, that the Russian-born dancer became known as a new type of ballerina in a modern mold. She was equally praised for her line and technique as a dancer in the classics.

The Nun [La Religieuse],"Vintage French Moyenne poster for the 1966 film. Nominated for a Palme d'Or at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. A flurry of controversy surrounded the production and release of Rivette's film. Upon facing pressure from the French Catholic Church regarding its critical religious and sexual content, the new Minister of Information, Yvon Bourges, banned its release. As a result, a massive campaign was launched in its defense, eventually leading to the ban being lifted. The story is based on Denis Diderot's eighteenth century novel of the same title. It was conceived as a practical joke, devised by Diderot, to persuade the Marquis de Croismare to return to Paris. He assumed the identity of a desperate young woman forced into a convent and wrote elaborate letters to the Marquis, beseeching him to help her. Eventually, Diderot compiled the letters and built on them to create his novel. Like the film, it too faced censorship, and was not officially published until after the writer's death.

The film was the start of Hitchcock's work in Hollywood under contract with producer David O. Selznick, a collaboration which produced six films in total, including \""Spellbound\"" (1945), \""The Paradine Case\"" (1947), and \""Under Capricorn\"" (1949). Although Selznick initially argued for \""Rebecca\"" to remain fully faithful to the plot of the novel, the Production Code Administration forbade murder to go unpunished, and as a result the film's ending differed from du Maurier's—a change which purportedly angered Selznick so strongly that he considered releasing the film without code approval.

"Original artwork for Nancy Sunday comic strip, January 31, 1971","Original eight-panel artwork by Ernie Bushmiller for the January 31, 1971 deluxe Sunday installment of his seminal comic strip Nancy. This strip features Nancy and her dog Poochie. As with American cinema, it was the French who first championed the studied simplicity of Bushmiller's un-deconstructible combination of rigid artistic style and even more rigidly governed humor. In 2012, Fantagraphics Press took on the long overdue task of putting the complete series into book form, a project that will take years to complete. In our estimation, Daniel Clowes put it best in his introduction to Fantagraphics' recently published first volume of Bushmiller's long run.

Obsession: The Films of Jess Franco,"First Edition. An utterly obsessive, minutely detailed examination of Spanish exploitation director Jess Franco's illustrious career, divided into two sections: an extensive, photo-illustrated filmography that includes analysis and reproductions of even the most obscure country-of-origin posters and advertisement for each film, and a set of interviews by Franco's contemporaries (and Franco himself), including Howard Vernon, Jack Taylor, William Berger, and others. Profusely photoillustrated throughout, with great tribute paid to the director's rarely-clothed, and rarely-sane leading ladies. While firmly in the pit of the horror-exploitation tradition, Franco distinguished himself by way of his colorful themes, which included lesbian vampires, women in prison, surgical horror, zombies, nuns, sadomasochism, and even cannibalism. He also incorporated elements of giallo, crime fiction, science fiction, and comedy into his work. Thought of by many to be the European Ed Wood, he churned out a nearly impossible number of films, many under pseudonyms, using a devoted circle of exhibitionist leading ladies, actors, and technicians over several decades, always working on a shoestring budget. An indispensable resource for the Francophile.

Mean Mother,"Original Pressbook for the 1974 Blaxploitation film \""Mean Mother\"". Notable as a slightly atypical Blaxploitation film hailing from Italy, \""Mean Mother\"" tells the story of two Vietnam War deserters who flee to Spain and Italy and get involved in the European crime world. Shot partly on location in Italy. Largely low-budget and geared towards a young urban audience, Blaxploitation films often depicted African-Americans overcoming hostile authorities through cunning and violence, as well as conflicts internal to the culture. Though some of the first mainstream films to feature predominantly black casts and introduce previously non-represented elements of black culture, including the notable use of funk and soul music in soundtracks, they were also panned for furthering stereotypes about black people. Despite the controversy that the genre instilled, its motifs remain culturally relevant to this day, often parodied, acknowledged, and imitated in modern films and music.

"Cherry, Harry and Raquel","Original French grande poster for the 1989 release of the 1970 US film. Scarce. A small-town border sheriff and marijuana smuggler sets out to kill a rival drug dealer, while his girlfriend has a dalliance with another woman. The first Meyer film to feature full frontal male nudity, a rarity even in sexploitation films at the time, and quite the introduction to soon-to-be Meyer’s regular Charles Napier. Meyer shot several new sequences late in production, about a quarter of the film’s runtime, either to replace footage lost by a photo lab, or because an actress left the shoot early (the reason is disputed). The new sequences, unrelated to the original ones, give the film an almost surreal quality, leading Roger Ebert to call it “possibly the only narrative film ever made without a narrative.” The film was one of the most successful of Meyer’s career, leading him to return to and refine this style in subsequent films, peaking with Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens in 1979. 47 x 63 inches, folded as issued.

"\""The Little Man with the Eyes\"" in 37 issues of Collier's Magazine 1940-1942","First Edition. Thirty-seven issues of Collier's Magazine, dated variously between April 20,1940 and July 11, 1942, all featuring Crockett Johnson's first magazine comic, \""The Little Man with the Eyes\"". This collection represents roughly a third of Johnson’s work for Collier’s. Johnson’s popularity as a sketch artist grew with the publication of “Harold and the Purple Crayon” (1955), but it was in an earlier comic strip, collectively known as “The Little Man with the Eyes,” where his humor was at its most subtle. Beginning in March, 1940, the comic ran for nearly three years, until January, 1943; Johnson’s other comic strip, “Barnaby,” a political series, was just taking off, begun in 1942. “The Little Man with the Eyes” usually featured four or five small vignettes of a little man with big white eyes, his facial expressions doing all of the narration. Subtle to the point of obscurity, the comic captured Johnson’s own gentle character, with apolitical themes, and capped the first phase of his career before venturing into children’s books. Issues range widely in condition, from Fair to Near Fine in illustrated, stapled wrappers.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Vintage poster for the 1971 run of the 1963 play at The Little Fox Theatre in San Francisco.

It wasn't until the San Francisco production, directed by Lee Sankowich, and debuting in 1970, that the play would find success, running there for five years and becoming \""the longest running drama in San Francisco history\"" (as noted on the poster, while only in its second year). That success led Sankowich and producing partner Rudi Golyn to mount a production off-Broadway, which debuted on March 23, 1971 and ran for a total of 1025 performances through September 16, 1973, first at the Mercer Arts Center and later at the Eastside Playhouse. That production starred Dan Devito as Martini, a role he would reprise for the 1975 film, and one he credits for launching his career.

Archive of 74 pressbooks and ad supplements for hardcore adult films made between 1966-1987,"An archive of 74 pressbooks and ad supplements for hardcore adult films released between 1966-1987, including a few foreign releases. A broad spectrum of advertising material for films screening strictly in adult theaters, mostly from the pre-video era. Design approach varies widely: early pressbooks were issued in black-and-white, then in two-color, then four-color, typically using a glossy finish rather than matte. The pressbooks vary in size, but generally hold to a format similar to that of a large tabloid, between 11 x 17 inches and 13 x 18 inches. Film studios issued pressbooks to exhibitors and theater companies to promote their upcoming releases and to educate the public with information on the stars of the film, with suggested blurbs for reviewers and campaigns to further publicity and interest surrounding the release. Often two or more films were represented in one pressbook (as is the case here in a few examples), a cost-saving measure for smaller film studios and distributors. Often included with the pressbook was an ad supplement, generally a single loose leaf placed inside the pressbook, carrying various ad mat examples for the prospective wholesale buyer.

Volumes 1, 2, and 4, of the short-lived (1933-1937) London film review magazine, focusing on avant-garde and international cinema. Published in the wake of the highly influential \""Close Up\"" magazine, \""Film Art\"" kept the flame lit as an important UK literary and film periodical, a few of the editors contributing most of the material, and a handful of others filling the gaps. The magazine was not opposed to completely ignoring the general public's view of cinema, and the editor, B. Vivian Braun (director of the 1934 short, \""Beyond This Open Road\""), centered much of the content on international cinema, particularly Soviet, French, and German.

Based on Thomas Page's 1973 novel. James Parmiter (Dillman) is a mad scientist who discovers the presence of a bizarre strain of mutant cockroach emerging from the earth after a severe earthquake.

Here, his steadfast vision of a trolley is presented almost always in glowing natural light, with passengers in boater and bowler hats, women in bonnets, and some faces intentionally blurred.

Probably no one has ever said it better than Bosley Crowther, who reviewed the film for the New York Times in 1961: \""Too sensitive and subtle for apt description are [Antonioni's] pictorial fashionings of a social atmosphere, a rarefied intellectual climate, a psychologically stultifying milieu—and his haunting evocations within them of individual symbolisms and displays of mental and emotional aberrations. Even boredom is made interesting. There is, for instance, a sequence in which a sudden downpour turns a listless garden party into a riot of foolish revelry, exposing the lack of stimulation before nature takes a flagellating hand.

Included is a manila envelope with the film title in holograph ink on the front, from the Pussycat Theatres in Hollywood, a chain of theaters that operated throughout California from the 1960s to the 1980s, specializing in pornographic and sexploitation films. This type of theatre was, presumably, a more consistent outlet for Russ Meyer and similar filmmakers than those that featured mainstream Hollywood films. A small-town border sheriff and marijuana smuggler sets out to kill a rival drug dealer, while his girlfriend has a dalliance with another woman. The first Meyer film to feature full frontal male nudity, a rarity even in sexploitation films at the time, and quite the introduction to soon-to-be Meyer’s regular Charles Napier. Meyer shot several new sequences late in production, about a quarter of the film’s runtime, either to replace footage lost by a photo lab, or because an actress left the shoot early (the reason is disputed). The new sequences, unrelated to the original ones, give the film an almost surreal quality, leading Roger Ebert to call it “possibly the only narrative film ever made without a narrative.” The film was","Eve Productions / Panamint Films,","Meyer, Russ (director, story) Tom McGowan (screenwriter) Larissa Ely, Linda Ashton, Charles Napier, Uschi Digard (starring)",325.0,InStock,USD

In the Heat of the Night,"Vintage borderless reference photograph of actors Arthur Malet, Sidney Poitier, and Rod Stieger filming a scene on the set of the 1967 film, a camera crew in the foreground. With holograph annotations on the verso regarding layout. Based on John Ball's 1965 novel. An African American police detective from Philadelphia is recruited to help solve a murder in a small, bigoted Mississippi town. The film dealt skillfully with the topic of race relations in the South during the Civil Rights movement, and included a controversial scene in which a white actor, Larry Gates, slaps Poitier in the face, at which point Poitier slaps him right back. It was said you could determine the racial makeup of a theater by their verbal reaction to the scene: cheers for a predominantly black audience, or whispers for a predominantly white one. Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and nominated for two others. Though set in the fictional town of Sparta, Mississippi, Poitier refused to travel below the Mason-Dixon Line, so the film was shot largely in Illinois. 8 x 10 inches. Near Fine.

Kubrick's carefully crafted film preserves the mystery, tragedy, and humor of Nabokov's source material, while adding a level of its own perversion—notably with its portrayal of Claire Quilty, represented in a performance by Peter Sellers that according to some sources was mostly improvised.

Kill! Kill!\"" in 1965 and before \""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\"" in 1970). What is less well known is that this film, by way of Ms. Gavin, marked a breakthrough in the onscreen portrayal of women in terms of sexual aggression, using the then-new platform of late 1960s American independent cinema and the aftermath of the Summer of Love as a canvas. Gavin's titular character is a married woman whose sexual boundaries are none, but instead of being a typical sex romp, the film heads off into areas that can be reasonably described as unexplored by sexploitation films, including communism, race relations, political debate, and terrorist activity. But also present in the film are many of the genre's more familiar themes (breast size, incest, nonstop sexual activity) and a generous dose of humor. 8 x","Eve Productions,","Meyer, Russ (director, producer) Robert Rudelson (screenwriter) Erica Gavin, Garth Pillsbury, Harrison Page, Jon Evans (starring)",150.0,InStock,USD

The Cavalcade of America: Young Tom Jefferson,"Draft script for \""A Continental Uniform,\"" an episode of the popular anthology drama radio show \""The Cavalcade of America,\"" originally broadcast on May 25, 1942. With faint holograph annotations in pencil and ink to the front wrapper. The anthology series was part of a campaign by the DuPont chemical corporation to rehabilitate its image following the public exposure of its arms race profiteering during World War I. In lieu of traditional advertising, Roy Durstine, the creative director of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, proposed that DuPont sponsor \""Cavalcade,\"" which integrated the company's slogan (\""Better Things For Better Living Through Chemistry\"") and agenda into its stories of American achievement and inspiration. The show was an early experiment in propagandistic corporate brand-building, virtually unprecedented for a company that had no commercially available products to market to the public. To further promote their clean, humanitarian ideals, DuPont shied away from using attention-grabbing tactics, such as the sound of gunfire, that were popular on other radio programs at the time, a choice that attracted pacifist writers such as Norman Rosten and Arthur Miller to the show. This episode dramatizes the life and political move to power of Thomas Jefferson, voiced by actor Tyrone Power.","Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn,","Richards, Robert (writer) Tyrone Power (starring)",75.0,InStock,USD

Bringing Up Baby,"Vintage double weight photograph of Katharine Hepburn, Howard Hawks, and a resting Cary Grant on the set of the 1938 film. One of the foundational entries in the canon of American screwball comedies. Based on the short story by Hagar Wilde which originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine on April 10, 1937. Zoologist David Huxley (Grant) develops a wary interest in the niece of dowager Mrs. Carelton Random (Hepburn), which, as in all great screwball comedies, is not finalized as a romance until about the last ten seconds of the film. But what makes this film singular is that the story is built around the maintenance aspects of raising a pet leopard, creating a rapid-fire blur of events and dialogue that doesn't let up for the entire 102-minute running time. The film bombed upon release, causing RKO to drop both of the stars, but today ranks as one of the best films made by either. 8 x 10 inches. Near Fine.

With a few holograph annotations in pencil and ink to the front wrapper. The anthology series was part of a campaign by the DuPont chemical corporation to rehabilitate its image following the public exposure of its arms race profiteering during World War I. In lieu of traditional advertising, Roy Durstine, the creative director of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, proposed that DuPont sponsor \""Cavalcade,\"" which integrated the company's slogan (\""Better Things For Better Living Through Chemistry\"") and agenda into its stories of American achievement and inspiration. The show was an early experiment in propagandistic corporate brand-building, virtually unprecedented for a company that had no commercially available products to market to the public. To further promote their clean, humanitarian ideals, DuPont shied away from using attention-grabbing tactics, such as the sound of gunfire, that were popular on other radio programs at the time, a choice that attracted pacifist writers such as Norman Rosten and Arthur Miller to the show.

The Story of Temple Drake,"Collection of five vintage photographs from the 1933 film, including three double weight and two single weight photographs. With stamps or holograph annotations to most of the photographs. Based on William Faulkner’s 1931 controversial literary potboiler, \""Sanctuary\"". The story concerns a wealthy and neurotic Southern belle who falls in with a violent bootlegger who rapes her and forces her into prostitution. Every bit as controversial as the source material, the film’s depiction of the assault was graphic and shocking even among films of the era, and, along with the same year’s equally sensational \""Baby Face,\"" was directly responsible for the stricter enforcement of the Production Code beginning the next year, bringing the pre-Code era to a close. George Raft, then under contract to Paramount, was assigned the role of the bootlegger, but found the part repulsive and went to battle with the studio in a suit that nearly cost him his career. Unavailable for decades outside of 16mm bootlegs, the film was restored by the Museum of Modern Art in 2011 and screened at the TCM Classic Film Festival, but still awaits a commercial release.

The first of Meyer's \""noir\"" cycle (1964-1965), or \""Gothic\"" period as Meyer puts it, a series of sexploitation films shot in black-and-white, powerful psycho-sexual female characters, male impotence, and a serious dramatic plot involving less of the \""nudie\"" filmmaking style so prominent in the director's early films.

What is less well known is that this film, by way of Ms. Gavin, marked a breakthrough in the onscreen portrayal of women in terms of sexual aggression, using the then-new platform of late 1960s American independent cinema and the aftermath of the Summer of Love as a canvas. Gavin's titular character is a married woman whose sexual boundaries are none, but instead of being a typical sex romp, the film heads off into areas that can be reasonably described as unexplored by sexploitation films, including communism, race relations, political debate, and terrorist activity. But also present in the film are many of the genre's more familiar themes (breast size, incest, nonstop sexual activity) and a generous dose of humor. 8 x 10 inches.

A poetic romance, illustrated throughout with photographs, depicting the languid posturing of the young von Harbous and their friends.

The von Harbou siblings’ playful luxuriating in Weimar’s pleasure gardens is very much in keeping with their Prussian aristocratic upbringing, but runs markedly and interestingly against the political seriousness of Thea’s later work, almost entirely a rebellion against the privilege of her youth.

Cinema Quarterly,"First Edition. Volumes One through Three, including the first issue, of the UK film review magazine, focusing on documentary and international cinema. The highly influential magazine lit a flame as an important European literary and film quarterly, generally considered the first English-language journal devoted to film as art, specifically documentary film. The editors were Norman Wilson and Forsyth Hardy, both regular contributors, along with the likes of John Grierson, a Scotsman often considered the father of British documentary film, and the man who familiarized the term \""documentary\"" in a 1926 film review for the \""New York Sun\"". The driving factor behind \""Cinema Quarterly\"" was the intent to highlight the \""empty masquerade of sham sentiments and false emotions that is the stock-in-trade\"" of commercialism, while simultaneously illuminating the burgeoning world of international avant-garde and documentary film. \""Cinema Quarterly\"" covered the latest film theory, with articles on directors like Grierson, Eisenstein, Joris Ivens, Alfred Hitchcock,and others, and featured black-and-white photographs throughout. In later years, the magazine changed its name to \""World Film News and Television Progress,\"" finally petering out in 1938 after 3 issues as \""SEE: World Film News\"".

Using a script based on the actual transcript notes taken during her trial, Bresson focuses on the psychological and physical torture that Joan had to endure, showing how these techniques were used to break her resolve and cause her to eventually recant her faith. \""With impeccable historical accuracy Bresson re-creates the story of the peasant girl who, after leading an unsuccessful revolt against the government, was brought to trial, convicted of heresy, and burned as a witch. However, Bresson shows Joan (Florence Carrez) as a woman more sophisticated and calculating and less naive than she has normally been represented.

Alien,"Revised Final Draft script for the 1979 British-American film. The script, with screenwriting credits for Walter Hill and David Giler, and story credits for Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, was made late in post production after principal photography had been completed, and features a note, following the title page, by screenwriters Hill and Giler, noting the \""script reflects dialogue changes added in post production for story clarification,\"" including computer readout information, effects shots, and scene transpositions and omissions. One of the greatest science fiction/horror films ever made, based on an original story by screenwriters O'Bannon and Shusett, and the auspicious debut of Ridley Scott. Ridley's franchise is so rich in themes and expandability that it has generated three sequels and two prequels of comparable (or nearly comparable) artistic merit. The infamous \""chest bursting\"" scene paved the way for future horror films to feature gore in more imaginative ways (but also caused viewers to vomit in theaters upon its initial release).

Boxing was already a popular subject for filmmakers, however, these were short films generally of single rounds.

Exquisite Sinner [The Exquisite Sinner],"Draft script for the 1926 film. Based on the 1924 novel \""Escape\"" by Alden Brooks. File copy rubber stamp to the front wrapper. Conrad Nagel and Renée Adoree star in this Silent film, today lost, originally directed by Josef von Sternberg. Midway into shooting Von Sternberg was fired by MGM and replaced by Phil Rosen. Rosen's many changes completely altered von Sternberg's version to the point that it was unrecognizable, and in a bizarre twist, MGM ultimately released both versions: the original one as \""Exquisite Sinner\"" in 1926 (credited to both Von Sternberg and Rosen, running 60 minutes), and Rosen's extensively reworked version as \""Heaven on Earth\"" in 1927 (runtime unknown). AFI Catalog notes that von Sternberg was replaced as director on January 17, 1926, which would place this script, dated in mid-December 1925, firmly within the time frame that von Sternberg was still the director. It is rumored that the Warner Brothers and Turner Entertainment archives hold a full print of this film, but as of 2014 no print has surfaced. Only a few images, promotional artwork and productions stills are currently known to exist. Set in France.

The Cavalcade of America: Mr. Lincoln Goes to the Play,"Draft script for \""Mr. Lincoln Goes to the Play,\"" an episode of the popular anthology drama radio show \""The Cavalcade of America,\"" originally broadcast on February 9, 1948. With holograph annotations in pencil and ink to the front wrapper. The anthology series was part of a campaign by the DuPont chemical corporation to rehabilitate its image following the public exposure of its arms race profiteering during World War I. In lieu of traditional advertising, Roy Durstine, the creative director of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn, proposed that DuPont sponsor \""Cavalcade,\"" which integrated the company's slogan (\""Better Things For Better Living Through Chemistry\"") and agenda into its stories of American achievement and inspiration. The show was an early experiment in propagandistic corporate brand-building, virtually unprecedented for a company that had no commercially available products to market to the public. To further promote their clean, humanitarian ideals, DuPont shied away from using attention-grabbing tactics, such as the sound of gunfire, that were popular on other radio programs at the time, a choice that attracted pacifist writers such as Norman Rosten and Arthur Miller to the show. This episode dramatizes the days leading up to Abraham Lincoln's assassination by John Wilkes Booth, with","Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn,","Hughes, Russell (writer) Robert Young (starring)",75.0,InStock,USD

Smith produced and narrated over 150 shorts between the 1930s and 1955, beginning his career at MGM as a publicist and moving on to narration when others noticed his knack for comedy. His unmistakable sharp tenor and nasal tone unwittingly became the analog, the voice we expect to hear in all shorts and news reels of the era, and he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award in 1953 for his work.

Additional underlining and bracketing throughout, in the same fountain pen ink as the inscription, mostly to the opening chapters of the text. The McCarthy / HUAC witch hunt saw Losey hounded out of the United States in the 1950s and, to his great regret, he never made another film in his home country. Professionally, though, it was the making of him as a director: in collaboration with Harold Pinter, Losey made a trilogy of legendary British films of the 1960s: \""The Servant,\"" \""Accident,\"" and \""The Go-Between\"". Pinter and Losey also worked closely together on an adaptation of Proust's \""In Search of Lost Time,\"" but although the script was later published the film remained unmade. Losey shared both a political philosophy and a cinema aesthetic with Alain Resnais, and Losey's 1978 film \""Roads to the South\"" is a sequel to Resnais' 1966 film \""The War is Over\"".

Tarzan and His Mate,"Draft script for the 1934 film. The second Tarzan film to star Johnny Weissmuller, with Jane famously portrayed by Maureen O'Sullivan. One of the best Tarzan films, and a landmark film in the history of film censorship. A big budget followup to MGM's first Tarzan film, \""Tarzan and His Mate\"" featured a lengthy balletic swimming scene between Tarzan and a nude Jane, with Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim doubling for Maureen O'Sullivan, one of the first completely nude scenes in a Hollywood film. The scene, along with the occasionally breast and buttocks revealing costume worn by O'Sullivan in other scenes, ran afoul of newly appointed Production Code Administration head Joseph Breen, who was determined to more strictly enforce decency standards than his predecessor, the Code's namesake Will Hays. The film was censored and changes were ordered by Breen. MGM appealed the decision to the Association of Motion Picture Producers but, despite the vigorous objections by Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, it became the first film to lose such an appeal. In total, eleven minutes were cut from the film, including the swimming scene, making it one of the first films affected by the new, more censorious PCA, and one that","Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer [MGM],","Gibbons, Cedric (director) Edgar Rice Burroughs (stories), James Kevin McGuinness, Howard Emmett Rogers (screenwritesr) Johnny Weissmuller, Maureen O'Sullivan (starring)",1500.0,InStock,USD

Visconti's trenchant first feature, an unauthorized adaptation of Cain's novel, often cited as the earliest neorealist film. Visconti himself saved a print of the film, the only reason it exists today, Mussolini having ordered the negative destroyed. The United States' reaction to the film wasn't much better, as Cain's publisher Alfred A. Knopf kept if off American screens until 1976. 27.5 x 19.5 inches.
